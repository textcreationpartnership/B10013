            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Dedicate this Impreſſion to you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your Bounty occaſioned it; and I am glad it did ſo, becauſe I think ſuch a Book may be always uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Church; in which, 'tis to be feared, ſome, both of the Clergy and Laity, will always want ſuch Advice as is therein offered. I did most affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately deſign this Book to Excite the most Serious Conſideration of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Solemn Offices of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayers; and to give aſſiſtance, as well as I could, towards ſuch performance as the thing deſerved. I could ſcarce hope (tho' I much deſir'd) that the Book ſhould have had ſo good Succeſs: But it pleaſed God (who best knew the ſincerity of my Affections) to move firſt our Right Reverend Dioceſan, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb facs="tcp:185082:4"/>another Biſhop, to recommend it to their Clergies; whereby the Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy thereof, to the end I deſigned, was much aſſiſted: And I do alſo impute this your Pious <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking, in giving a Book to every Lad that is put out Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice, unto the ſame Divine Motion; And I verily believe, that, if theſe young Men would argue from your giving it them as they ought, it would mightily help to effect in them what I deſire: For which reaſon I crave your pardon, for expoſing an imperfect Character of you, while I endeavour to inſtruct them ſo to do. This Book, may they ſay, was given us by our Worthy Treaſurer, who was ſo much eſteemed in the City for his Wiſdom, Piety and Readineſs to all good Works as to be unanimouſly choſen to that Office; And that, in the diſcharge of it, hath out-done the Expectations of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors, and the Example of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and hath rendred himſelf a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Pattern to all that come after him. The wholſomneſs of our Food, our warm and whole Cloathing, our ſweet, cleanly
<pb facs="tcp:185082:4"/>and well repaired Lodgings, our well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed School-maſters, our diligent and careful Nurſes and Attendants of all ſorts, ſhews his great care of us: and all Men ſee the ſame in the healthineſs of our Countenances; which is obſerved to be, beyond what was formerly: And how can we but conclude, that he, who was ſo kind to our Bodies, gave us this Book in kindneſs to our Souls; which he knew and we ought to conſider) are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely better. And even for our Souls alſo we have found his Care exceeding great; for he hath cauſed us to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Reaſons of Worſhipping God: and in the Right Way of doing it, both in Private, and in Publick: and we hear others applaud our good Order and decent Performance, in both reſpects, while we daily, Morning and Evening, Worſhip God in this great Family; and every Lord's day most ſolemnly Praiſe him in the greater Congregation; imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the heavenly Host, whoſe Voice was like that of many Waters or mighty Thunders in ſaying their Hallelujahs,
<pb facs="tcp:185082:5"/>
               <hi>Rev. 19.</hi> And this aſſures us he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this Book would teach us ſomething very beneficial in that reſpect: And wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I hope alſo, that your thus approving the Book, will perſwade more of my Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Citizens to read it, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may be drawn from the Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of Coffee-houſe Converſation, unto thoſe holy Exerciſes of God's Worſhip, wherein they may find much better Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; a Diverſion which is as Rational and Sublime, as that is Mean and Fooliſh.</p>
            <p>This little I have hinted to further the deſign of my Book not that I thought to add to the Fame of your Vertues, but rather to expreſs that true Reſpect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, which they have begotten in me: Who am,</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THERE is no Chriſtian that prays in the words which his Lord hath taught him, but doth implicitely profeſs his deſire that theſe Papers may be <hi>read and conſidered:</hi> For the firſt thing be there prays for, is <hi>the hallowing God's Name;</hi> which is, <hi>That God will give his Grace to us, and all People, that we may worſhip him as we ought to do,</hi> as our Catechiſm hath taught us. Now the deſign of this Book being only to <hi>give aſſiſtance to the worſhipping God as we ought,</hi> he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the doing of <hi>that,</hi> muſt alſo the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>this.</hi> For how meanly ſoever the <hi>thing</hi> be done, it cannot but occaſion ſome thoughts in Mens minds, and ſome diſcourſe in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny upon <hi>this Subject;</hi> whereby it is very prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, many things which in the ordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance have been amiſs, may be obſerved and amended, which would not have otherwiſe been
<pb facs="tcp:185082:6"/>thought on; and Men may be excited to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what is fit to be done, <hi>that this Service may be moſt decently and ſolemnly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</hi> And if it do but this, I have my end. I do not impoſe my Dictates on any, but offer things to <hi>Conſideration</hi> with all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; acknowledging, that both my want of Learning, Time, Health, and due Compoſure, make me unfit to write for publick View: but my fervent deſire to ſee things ordered in the beſt manner in <hi>this Service,</hi> which I have found ſo <hi>comfortable</hi> to my ſelf, and deſire may be more <hi>eſteemed and frequented</hi> by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, hath perſwaded this Eſſay; which I hope will offend none. If any ſhould blame my boldneſs in medling with thoſe of the Miniſtry, my excuſe muſt be, in the Obſervation of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Gentleman, <hi>That even the Lamps of the Sanctuary may need Snuffers to make them burn the clearer.</hi> I know he ſaith, they ought to be of Gold; and I wiſh mine were better Metal: But I hope the purity of my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, will make amends for the meanneſs of of my Style and Expreſſion, and procure a kind Acceptance with that Sacred Tribe.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon occaſion of this Second Edition, I muſt add this to the Reader: That I was forced in the firſt, to cut off much of what I deſigned, that ſo I might accomn odate the Book to what
<pb facs="tcp:185082:6"/>the Bookseller would venture to print: but he, now grown more bold by the good ſucceſs of his firſt undertaking, gives me liberty to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute my firſt Intentions; wherefore I here make ſome Inlargements; and I have done it with good intentions, for the exciting a <hi>ſerious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in theſe Holy Exerciſes of God's Worſhip, which</hi> by the prevalency of falſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, and vicious Practices, is greatly decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and I have done it with full perſwaſion of mind, but without contempt of any that are otherwiſe affected. I pity all that will not make a through tryal of the Felicity of a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Life, and of this practice of Holineſs which is according to the example of the ancienteſt and pureſt Times, and as purged from all Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and Fanaticiſm, (for ſuch, I think is that I recommend.) And I am the more moved to this compaſſion, by the experience I have of the good ſucceſs of this practice in my ſelf. I was bred to the exerciſe of Piety in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Way, and endeavoured to be devout therein, as my Conſcience told me I ought. I converſed with the wiſeſt and beſt I lived with, and had ſome Intereſts among them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me to a continuance in that Way; but when it pleaſed God to bring in <hi>another Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> I thought it my Duty to conſider well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſat down in a fixed Diſobedience. I thought I could not expreſs <hi>the honour I ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:185082:7"/>to my Superiours,</hi> if I ſhould refuſe to conſider what was ſaid for Obedience to their Laws; nor yet <hi>the love I ſhould have for Communion with all Chriſtians, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe to whom I was united by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Obligations,</hi> if I ſhould forſake it on Scruples eaſily reſolved, or for the bare liking of ſome other Mode of Worſhip, as better than that they uſed. And upon an impartial conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of what I have heard and read, (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never balked any Argument that I met with againſt the lawfulneſs of Lay-Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity;) I am now ſatisfied that it is my Duty to obey the publick Order: and having endeavoured to do it with the Devotion I ought, I have found it no way inferiour (to ſpeak the leaſt) to what I was formerly uſed to, as to the uſes and benefits of publick Worſhip, and eſpecially to the exerciſe and entertainment of a heavenly Mind. This experience moved the Importunity uſed to Miniſters and People in this Book that they which Conform might do it ſo devoutly, as might he to the comfort of themſelves, and attracting others to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. And I have inſinuated ſome Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to inforce the ſame, as ſo brief a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe would permit; which, with the former, I recommend unto God's Bleſſing, and a candid Interpretation; being reſolved to make no more Additions thereunto, although it ſhould have
<pb facs="tcp:185082:7"/>the good hap to be printed again. I hope they will not be angry with me, that have bought any of the firſt Edition, becauſe I believe moſt of them are ſuch, as Six-pence will not much concern; and it will be a good Work for them (if they have a mind to this Book) to give the former where they find any guilty of the Faults therein noted: and in this they will very much gratifie the Author of the Book, who deſires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more in this World, than to ſee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Order of our Church obſerved with that Care and Conſideration (as well as with true Devotion) that it may have its true Beauty in the eyes of all good Men, and may alſo have a mighty efficacy to their Spiritual Joy and Conſolation in this Holy and Heavenly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and to the Reformation and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their Minds and Lives.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Worſhip of God</hi> is a thing much talked of (and that with great Reverence) by many who have not (as I think) ſuch Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of it as they ought. And on the other hand, of ſome it is as much ſlighted, as if there were ſomething of <hi>Fanaticiſm</hi> in all Pretences to <hi>Devotion.</hi> My Deſign therefore in this <hi>Preface</hi> ſhall be, to beget <hi>Right Thoughts</hi> about it, and a <hi>Due Eſteem</hi> thereof; as I have in what follows endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to direct a <hi>Right Behaviour</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>If Men would conſider the thing, it would not be difficult to underſtand what the true Notion of <hi>Divine Worſhip</hi> is. Every Man
<pb facs="tcp:185082:8"/>knows what it is to <hi>give Worſhip</hi> in the common ſence of that word, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That it is to ſignifie our Reſpects to Perſons above us, by <hi>reverent actions</hi> ſuted unto their Dignity: And ſo it muſt principally ſignifie when it is applied unto God, <hi>The expreſſion of the greateſt Dread and Reverence towards his Glorious and Tremendous Deity by the moſt humble Poſtures of Adoration.</hi> This hath been the ſence of all Mankind concerning this Matter, and this is the ſence of the Holy Scriptures; and this all the Chriſtian World agreed in, until the Corruptions and Cruelties of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> made thoſe that juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed her in many things, to forſake o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, without any other reaſon, but the hatred of being like to <hi>Her,</hi> who had been ſo cruel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. And among theſe, I reckon this to be the chief; That they not only left off the <hi>Daily Offices</hi> of God's Publick Worſhip, but alſo that <hi>Ancient Order</hi> for the performance thereof on the Lord's Day, which was moſt accommodate unto the conjunction of theſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Devotion and Adoration; by which means, bowing the Head, and Body, and Knees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which have in them the principal ſence of that word <hi>Worſhip</hi>) have become almoſt quite out of uſe among them.</p>
            <p>I cannot imagine, for my own part, any other reaſon why theſe <hi>ſolemn Actions</hi> ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb facs="tcp:185082:9"/>ſo wholly diſuſed; for I cannot believe that any who are acquainted with what is written of the former or preſent Cuſtoms of the World, can be ignorant what the uſage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath ever been, and ſtill is, in worſhipping whatever they called God: nor did I ever hear it proved, that their common ſence did herein deceive them. It ſeems to me alſo, that it is impoſſible for any that read the Scripture, to be ignorant that when it ſpeaks of any Perſon or Aſſembly <hi>that they worſhipped the Lord,</hi> it means principally, they bowed their Heads before him in acknowledgement of his Deity, or in a ſence of Gratitude for his Mercies; nor that theſe two words, <hi>Bowed</hi> and <hi>Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,</hi> are almoſt every where in Scripture joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together. And thoſe that have read Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Hiſtories, or converſed with any of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churebes (even thoſe that never were of the Popiſh Communion) will find, that it is not the Papiſts only among Chriſtians, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in theſe ſolemn Acts of Adoration; but that they ever were, and ſtill are uſed by all Chriſtians (and by ſome as much, if not more than by them) except only thoſe whom I ſpeak of, who have forſaken them on the account a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid.</p>
            <p>Certainly there is ſome Reaſon upon which this common Conſent is grounded, and for which this expreſſion hath ever been made, by
<pb facs="tcp:185082:9"/>good Men of the Worſhip and Honour they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to give to Almighty God, and hath ever been accepted and approved of him; and for the ſame reaſon it ought not to be forſaken and diſuſed of us. And indeed, the very general Cuſtom and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage of the World, and of the Church, hath ſo much reaſon in it ſelf, that it ſhould be evidently proved there is poſitive Sin, or great Inconvenience in the things recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended thereby, before we venture to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict or oppoſe them. We are commanded to <hi>give no Offence to the</hi> Jew, <hi>nor</hi> Greek, <hi>nor Church of God:</hi> whereas it ſeems to me, by forſaking theſe ſolemn Acts of Adoration we offend them all. And I verily believe, nothing more perſwades the Papiſts of the Goodneſs of their own Religion, and makes them think ill of ours, than obſerving the Decency of theſe ſolemn Actions ſo frequently uſed in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service, and that it ſcarce looks like the Worſhip of God where they are wholly omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as they are in ſome Proteſtant Churches, and in all Nonconformiſts Meetings, and too much in our Parochial Aſſemblies alſo.</p>
            <p>But it is not only the avoiding Offence that ſhould recommend theſe ſolemn Actions, (and eſpecially that of Bowing) but many great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: <hi>1.</hi> There is <hi>nothing more effectual to impreſs on the mind a ſence of God's Preſence,</hi> than this action of Bowing before
<pb facs="tcp:185082:10"/>him. It is impoſſible a Man can uſe ſuch an Action, but he muſt think there is ſome One preſent to whom it is performed; and where Men have not a true belief of God's preſence, and are conſcious unto themſelves of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it will ſeem ſo unreaſonable and fooliſh to perform ſuch acts of Adoration, that they will be hardly perſwaded thereunto. And for this reaſon, when the World became ſo carnaliz'd by indulging their brutiſh Part, that they could ſcarce have any apprehenſion of <hi>inviſible Things</hi> but by the help of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was the Object of their Senſes, they invented <hi>Images</hi> to repreſent the inviſible Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they worſhipped; and fancied that by their Incantations and Charms, their Gods were drawn to inhabit thoſe Images; by which means they found they were helped in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming thoſe Acts of Adoration to them. But the only living and true God hath utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden any ſuch Repreſentations of himſelf, as being a diſhonour to the infinite Glory and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality of his Nature, but yet requires Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Worſhip from us, in acknowledgment than he is every where preſent, but eſpecially in the Aſſemblies that meet to do him honour and ſervice; and that he, and he only, <hi>is to be feared, and had in reverence of all that are about him:</hi> and if we would perform this act of Adoration as we ought, we ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:185082:10"/>find great help thereby, againſt the weakneſs of our Faith, and the dulneſs of our Spiritual Sence; and it would beget in us ſuch an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual apprehenſion of God's ſpiritual and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Preſence, that it would be as a new nature or principle of ſpiritual and holy Life in all other things: I ſay, if we perform it as we ought; becauſe I would have none think that I impute a Magical Force to this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if all that do it, on what account ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſhould become inſpired with ſuch an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual ſence of God and his univerſal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. For I know, that where this is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, Men may be very obſervant thereof for carnal ends; and be inwardly Atheiſtical, and outwardly prophane ſtill: but if it be done with a deſign to ſignifie our belief of God's preſence, and our awful ſence of his infinite Glory and Greatneſs, it hath tendency to work a habit of ſpiritual ſenſibility in this matter, and by the efficacie of the ſame we ſhall be continually kept in the fear of offending God, and excited to all holy and vertuous Actions that are pleaſing to him: which I think is a very weighty matter.</p>
            <p>Beſides, <hi>it prepares and diſpoſes our minds to the performance of all the Offices of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip, whereby we explicate the ſignification of ſuch acts of Adoration:</hi> and therefore it hath been uſed to be done at our
<pb facs="tcp:185082:11"/>firſt coming into the Church, that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what we are chiefly to intend in all we do there, <hi>viz. The Worſhip and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Almighty God.</hi> The want of this conſideration, is a cauſe of great miſchiefs in the Church: Men have learnt to think, that all the Miniſtries of Religion are intended to <hi>work on their Affections and Paſſions, and to gratifie a Religius Fancy;</hi> and ſo they judge they are beſt ordered, when they ſerve moſt effectually to that end: and upon this account it is, that they condemn the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer</hi> as a dead Form, and cry up the <hi>Extempore Way,</hi> as the only acceptable Mode of ſerving God. And while they thus judge, they are ſubject to be drawn into Schiſm and Errour by every ſubtile Seducer that can han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the Inſtrument of his Tongue well, and affect their minds with ſome devout Paſſions. For ſo long as they think <hi>That</hi> Way of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion beſt which moſt affects them, (Novelty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a great force in that matter, and Men that deſign to ſerve their Intereſts by making Diſciples, being apt to bend their minds moſt ſtrenuouſly to ſtudy to ſpeak to Mens paſſions) Men can never be fix'd in any way of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But now if they were once perſwaded that thoſe publick Adminiſtrations are beſt, which ſerve moſt fitly to <hi>the Worſhip and Adoration of the Deity,</hi> and are moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
<pb facs="tcp:185082:11"/>for the conjunction of theſe <hi>ſolemn Actions</hi> which I here ſpeak of; it would be hard for them to find any better than ours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe which ſeparate from us.</p>
            <p>For the better underſtanding the beginning of the foregoing Paragraph, wherein I ſay, That in the Offices of Divine Worſhip we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the ſignification of the acts of Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I muſt obſerve, <hi>1.</hi> That, as the Worſhip we perform to God, by humbly bowing down in our approach to his glorious Majeſty, doth declare our obligation unto all we perform in the following Offices; ſo thoſe Offices do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the explication of the <hi>Worſhip</hi> we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by give to the Almighty. For ſince we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare by that action, that we <hi>worſhip</hi> him as the only true God, we oblige ourſelves to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that ſervice which Deity makes his due: and this we do, when we give him thanks for <hi>the great benefits we have received at his hands,</hi> and <hi>ſet forth his moſt worthy praiſe;</hi> when we attend diligently to his <hi>holy Word,</hi> and ſeek at his hands <hi>things requiſite and neceſſary for Body and Soul:</hi> for by theſe things we do acknowledge him to be the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our Being, and of all the benefits whereof we are Partakers, and to be the free and gracious Donor thereof; and that he is moſt worthy of all the Praiſe and Glory that we can give him, as by reaſon thereof, ſo alſo
<pb facs="tcp:185082:12"/>becauſe of the infinite Perfections of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and his mighty and wonderful Works which we behold: That he is infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Truth, and to be believed in all that be reveals to us: That he is our only ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Law-giver, and to be obeyed in all that he commands us: That he is our Soveraign Lord, and our Weal or Wo doth wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on his Favour or Diſpleaſure; and that no Arts or Labours of our own can ſecure us againſt Miſery, or inſtate us in true Felicity, whether it be internal or external, preſent or future, but that our whole dependance is on his Favour and Bleſſing. And all this, and much more, is contained in our acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be God; which we do, by <hi>bowing down</hi> before him in the place of his <hi>Publick Worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Since the chief end of our Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is the moſt explicite worſhipping God, by acknowledging thoſe things which Deity doth imply; It is very meet that we joyn this act of <hi>Adoration</hi> with our <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Praiſes,</hi> in fit places; as, at the mention of God's glorious Titles and Attributes in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Collects; and when we implore his gracious acceptance through the Merits of our bleſſed Saviour in the concluſion thereof: and there are alſo many places in the <hi>Te De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> and in the other Hymns and Pſalms,
<pb facs="tcp:185082:12"/>where this action is very fit, both to expreſs our ſence of God's preſence, our reverence towards him, our belief that he ſees us, and that he hears all we ſpeak to him; and alſo to keep our Devotion in life and ſtrength, and to aſſiſt it in each other. I find in many places of Scripture, where the manner of the ſolemn ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the People unto God is deſcribed, that they did <hi>bow their heads</hi> and <hi>worſhip,</hi> in conjunction with their <hi>Praiſes</hi> and <hi>Prayers:</hi> And it ſeems to me, that there is ſuch a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Decency in the thing, that all unprejudiced Perſons muſt approve it. Sure I am, that the devout behaviour of ſuch as I have known to be truly pious Men in this kind, hath had a great influence on me; and I may think it will have the like on others.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> That it ſeems to me, that the intention of Mind which is required to the ſpeaking in any good Sence and Method in the <hi>Extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> way of Prayer, is a great hindrance to the due uſe of ſuch acts of Worſhip in the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and that the neceſſary attention to what is ſpoken, and the inward diſcourſe of Reaſon, whether it be fit for us to joyn with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter therein, is as great hindrance to ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in the Hearers.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> That the brief and comprehenſive Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers into which the general Office of Prayer in our Way is divided, ſeems much better in this
<pb facs="tcp:185082:13"/>reſpect, than if the ſeveral matters whereof they conſiſt were compoſed into one long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Prayer.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5.</hi> That it would be very convenient that every one would keep to their own Pariſh-Church, where they might have conveniencies to perform both this and other Expreſſions of Devotion, better than they can in a Crowd; into which many throng for leſſer benefits than they might have by a devout performance of theſe Holy Offices.</p>
            <p>This then I conceive (according to what I have ſaid before) to be the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of God: When Men knowing and conſidering that there is one eternal infinite Being, of moſt glorious and tremendous Majeſty, of incomprehenſible Goodneſs, Wiſdom, and Power; and that is preſent in all places: who, having made us with ſuch powers and faculties as fit us for his Worſhip and Service, and enriched us with ſuch benefits as give us greateſt obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereunto, doth expect that we perform the ſame to the greateſt advantage of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Honour. I ſay, when we knowing this, go unto the place of God's <hi>Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> and there do by <hi>actions</hi> worſhip God, <hi>bowing our Heads and Knees</hi> before him, and alſo by <hi>words;</hi> declaring our belief of his Being, Preſence, Perfections, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Works, and our thankfulneſs for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb facs="tcp:185082:13"/>Mercies, and joy and delight in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; when we humbly and ſeriouſly attend to the ſolemn reading of his Divine Truth, the Hiſtories of his mighty Works, to his Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Threatnings whereby he hath enforced his Laws, to the Prophecies and miraculous Gifts whereby he hath aſſured us the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is from himſelf, though by Miniſtry of Men; and ſuch-like things, of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the glory of God, as well as our good, which we hear out of the Holy Scriptures: As alſo, when we make our Supplications and Prayers before him as our ſupream Lord and Governour, and thereby acknowledge his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Preſence and Providence extending to all Times, Places, and Perſons, with all their circumſtances, even in the minuteſt things, and withal over-ruling the greateſt: And when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> all theſe we intermix due Acts of <hi>Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as continually intent on the conſideration of God's Preſence, and waiting for occaſions, in the Offices of Praiſe, Hearing, and Prayers, to adore his Divine Majeſty internally and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, and to expreſs our devout affections by ſuch actions as <hi>bowing</hi> and <hi>lifting up our eyes and hands</hi> to Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and alſo <hi>kneeling</hi> and <hi>ſtanding</hi> as it is moſt fitly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Church: And when every one at the concluſion of the Service uſing ſome ſhort Ejaculation to beg God's pardon for what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb facs="tcp:185082:14"/>we have been guilty of, and his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of our ſincere deſire to honour him, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bowing before him at our leaving the Church; <hi>this</hi> I conceive hath very much Conformity to what all Men (that conſider their natural apprehenſions of things) will judge moſt like to that, which is the plain ſence of Worſhipping God.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſome wonder to me, that many who ſeem to have a great Zeal for the Worſhip of God, and make every thing they do about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion a part thereof (as the <hi>Church-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> (which they add to <hi>that</hi> of Baptiſm) and the Suffrage of the People in the matter of the Ordination of Miniſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) ſhould be ſo inobſervant of that Worſhip which Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens have known by the Light of Nature to be due to God, and which all that ever worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped a God (true or falſe) have uſed. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Law of Nature is God's moſt p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Law, and cannot be altered while things remain the ſame; and all Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions in the matter of Worſhip, do but ſupply the Defects of that Law, and were Modes of Worſhip added (for ſpecial reaſons) to that which Nature taught, but no way excluſive thereof, or contrary thereunto; and the Sacraments of the New Teſtament are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted on the ſame account. Beſides, I have obſerved in the Writings of the <hi>Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:185082:14"/>an acknowledgment of the Duty of Natural Worſhip, and of the uſe of ſuch Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Actions whereof it conſiſts, but always this of <hi>Bowing</hi> (which is the chief) is left out of the Catalogue, and ſome hard Names, ſuch as <hi>Cringing, Geſticulation,</hi> &amp;c. put upon it to diſgrace it; of which I never could find any reaſon, but their enmity to our Church, and their diſuſe of it in their own Way. 'Tis true, in <hi>one</hi> I find <hi>this, That Cuſtom doth limit and determine Nature's Laws; upon which account, Proſtration, and wearing Sack-cloth, and rending Garments, are now diſuſed.</hi> And <hi>Bowing</hi> (ſince it is ſtill left out) ſeems to be put among the number of thoſe Natural Actions determined by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom. But what Cuſtom is this? Surely not the Cuſtom of the Community of Mankind, nor of the Church of Chriſt, but of ſome that have almoſt baniſhed all other Expreſſions of Devotion, but ſuch which may be as proper to the hearing any Tragical Story, as to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. But though Nature only teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the uſe of ſuch Behaviour in worſhipping God as is moſt <hi>expreſſive</hi> of our Reverence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and Cuſtom may make ſome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation of thoſe <hi>Expreſſions;</hi> yet this Act of <hi>Bowing</hi> ſeems ſo naturally fit to expreſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and ſo decent, that it hath become <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            <p>I know that it is alſo ſaid, that the Act of Parliament forbids the uſe of any other Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies than what are mentioned in the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick;</hi> and that this being not mentioned, it would be an act of Diſobedience to uſe it. To which I anſwer, That the natural Expreſſions of Worſhip and Reverence to Almighty God cannot be there meant: for then, lifting up the Hands and Eyes to Heaven, may be thought forbidden as well as this; which I think none will affirm: But as God himſelf hath not inſtituted any thing poſitively, (no not in the time of the Law, when he was (as it were) the Temporal Monarch of the <hi>Jews</hi>): about his Natural Worſhip, (ſuch as was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in their Synagogues) ſo our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours have not thought fit to inſtitute any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this Caſe, but leave it to be done by every one as his Devotion moves him; but certainly they never intended to forbid it, as is here ſuggeſted.</p>
            <p>It is alſo ſaid by ſome, that it may make the Service of God ſeem ludicrous, by being done too much; and every one hath not diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to do it as he ought, and will be apt to exceed; that the Papiſts are grown to ſuch an extream in this action of Bowing, and ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:185082:15"/>Geſticulations about it, that their Service is ridiculous to <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> &amp;c. To which I anſwer: As to the Papiſts, I can be no Judge in that matter, becauſe I never ſaw the full Order of their Service; but I know that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eſteem ill of things they are not uſed to, without juſt cauſe: the uſe of <hi>Muſick</hi> and <hi>Artificial Singing,</hi> of <hi>Reſponſes</hi> and <hi>Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Readings</hi> in Divine Service, ſeem ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to ſome that have been educated in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Way. Beſides, what the Papiſts are thought to exceed in, is matter of Inſtitution; the time and place of their Bowing, Croſſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being directed by their Rubrick (as I have read) but that which I ſpeak of is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Liberty, in which I never ſaw or heard that there was exceſs. That People left at liberty ſhould be too much in bowing their Heads and Knees in Adoration of him they worſhip, in lifting up their Hands and Eyes to Heaven, in expreſſion of their fervent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſeems to me no way to be feared. 'Tis like ſome few (eſpecially of the younger ſort) that are much affected by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the decency of this in ſome Miniſters that practiſe it; being ſuch, as by the holineſs of their Life, and excellency of their Doctrine, have obtained a great reverence with them; I ſay, they may ſeem (and I think but ſeem) too zealous in this matter: but as
<pb facs="tcp:185082:16"/>the generality are far enough from that fault, and more like to be aſhamed to do what their Conſciences tell them is very decent, (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when done by grave Men) than to exceed therein; ſo I think the fear of it ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter no Man from recommending a due and decent Performance, which is all this Paper aims at. But ſuppoſing this to be true, that Men do or may thus exceed, it ſeems an ill way of arguing, That becauſe a thing may be over-done, therefore it ſhould not be done at all. Some find fault with <hi>Extempore</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that they are too long; and others, with ours in the Common Prayer, that they are too ſhort: Should any Man now ſay, 'Tis beſt then to have no Prayers at all? yet 'tis a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:185082:16"/>all that do not hold or practiſe as I do: but I humbly offer this, as other things, to the conſideration of the Wiſe, being willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any thing in my thoughts or actions that I ſhall be convinced to be amiſs. And do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that thoſe Church-men, who uſe not this action, have better reaſon for it than I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of; or elſe on farther conſideration, may do as moſt Churches in the World, and moſt of their Brethren have given them example.</p>
            <p>I ſhall farther obſerve, as to this matter of God's Worſhip, <hi>That God expects ſuch Worſhip from us, as is ſutable to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations he hath made of himſelf.</hi> It was cauſe of his great diſpleaſure againſt the Gentile World, that <hi>when they knew him to be God, they did not worſhip him as God: when</hi> his <hi>eternal Power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> (though inviſible in itſelf) was <hi>made evident by the Works of his Creation</hi> which they had continually before their eyes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might have learnt to worſhip him as an infinite incorruptible Spirit, yet they would worſhip him under the Reſemblances of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Things;</hi> which was a diſhonour to the Eternity and Omnipotency of his Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>But now our bleſſed Saviour hath farther revealed the incomprehenſible Deity, as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in a Trinity of Perſons in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of
<pb facs="tcp:185082:17"/>its Eſſence, and as manifeſted in our Fleſh, in the ſecond Perſon of that bleſſed Trinity: which revelation of God requires ſomething pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar in the matter of Divine Worſhip from us Chriſtians. It hath been received as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Faith by the Catholick Church, That <hi>the Trinity in Unity, and the Unity in Trinity is to be worſhipped;</hi> and that our bleſſed Saviour, as God and Man, is to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured <hi>as we honour the Father.</hi> Now it ſeems to me, that there is ſuch an excellent Order in our Liturgy for the performance of the Worſhip of God and our bleſſed Saviour according to theſe Evangelical Revelations, that 'tis ſcarce to be equalled in any other Way, eſpecially that which is ſet up in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with it. And I doubt not, all thoſe that will impartially conſider the <hi>Reſponſes,</hi> the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> (which we ſo frequently uſe, becauſe it is ſuitable to this <hi>Goſpel-Worſhip,</hi> (of which yet ſome complain there is great defect in our Liturgy) as alſo the <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Letany,</hi> and the <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-Service,</hi> and how God in theſe is honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Three Perſons, and yet but one God; and our Saviour invocated and acknowledged as God-man advanced to the higheſt dignity at the right hand of God; I ſay, he that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders this, I hope, will think as I do. I know prejudice hinders Men from obſerving what is
<pb facs="tcp:185082:17"/>excellent in any thing, but eſpecially in ſuch things they are not uſed to: but as I ſuppoſe none will deny that God is thus to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; ſo, where Men are not prejudiced, I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe they will think, that in no Way they can do it better.</p>
            <p>There is ſomething alſo to be inferred, as to this matter of God's Worſhip, from the plentiful effuſion of the Spirit in Goſpel-times, and our Fellowſhip and Communion in that Spirit. There are ſome Phraſes in the New Teſtament, which, I think have been perverted to a wrong ſence, ſuch as <hi>Praying in the Holy Ghoſt, Worſhipping God in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and in Spirit and Truth:</hi> which I think may better be referred to the worſhipping God as revealed by the Goſpel (which is called <hi>the Miniſtration of the Spirit</hi>) in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect forementioned; or elſe to our worſhipping God in Faith and Fervency, in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nanimity, without diſtinction of Jew and Gentile; in ſpirituality, without legal Types and Figures, and carnal Ordinances; in the vertue of Chriſt's Merits, which was the truth of all the bloudy Sacrifices of Atonement for acceptance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with God in the legal Worſhip; and this, according to the Revelations where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Spirit of Chriſt is Author, and by whoſe Gifts and Powers they were confirmed: I ſay, better refered to theſe things, than to
<pb facs="tcp:185082:18"/>praying without ſtudy or a prepared Form, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by help of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to me, that if thoſe Expreſſions had any relation to praying by any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and ſupernatural aſſiſtance of God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, (as was their praying in Languages they had never learnt, or in Expreſſions that were above any attainments they could be ſuppoſed to have by ordinary means) it muſt be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able only unto that time. For, however an Opinion hath been inſinuated of late, of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous and ſupernatural aſſiſtance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for the performance of that Duty, which hath given conſidence to many (who are naturally unable for the ſame) to venture on it, and that even in publick Adminiſtration, to the great diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Religion, and juſt offence of all wiſe Men: yet I think none will dare to affirm, that any Chriſtian or Miniſter hath any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe from God of ſuch aſſiſtance of the Spirit, as may make it to be truly ſaid, that be <hi>prays in the Spirit</hi> in the ſence above-mentioned. But now praying in the Spirit, as I firſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted it of praying as the Revelations of the Spirit of Chriſt in the Goſpel requires, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable to all Times and Perſons: and this I think to be done (as in the forementioned reſpect of worſhipping the Trinity in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, and our Lord and Saviour as God-man, ſo alſo) <hi>when our Prayers are ordered for the greateſt
<pb facs="tcp:185082:18"/>advantage of Faith and Fervency, and of the Unity and Fellowſhip of the Spirit;</hi> and ſo I think ours are ordered.</p>
            <p>For in the firſt place, our <hi>Faith</hi> is helped, by the aſſurance that we ask ſuch things as are pleaſing to God; and ſecondly, by the frequent mention of the merits of Chriſt: When we pray in the words which our Lord and Saviour himſelf hath taught us, and uſe ſuch Forms as have been compoſed by Men fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in the Church, and approved by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Chriſtians, and that for many Ages: when our Prayers are ordered with great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of thoſe that are moſt learned among our ſelves, (being alſo ſuch as are orderly called to direct the publick Miniſtrations in Sacred Things) and when they are approved by all the Chriſtians united into one National Church under one Civil Government, (which approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is declared by the Repreſentatives of both Clergy and Laity, with whoſe advice they are by Law eſtabliſhed) and when we ourſelves may conſider and weigh the ſame before we uſe them, having them in our Books to read at any time; certainly we may on all theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts he more aſſured that we pray for ſuch things as we ought, than when we joyn in a Prayer we never heard before, and ſuch as is the ſudden conception of a private Miniſter, (as the uſe is with thoſe that are againſt our
<pb facs="tcp:185082:19"/>Way.) And finally, the frequent mention of the Merits of our Saviour at the concluſion of our brief Collects, is more helpful to our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that we ſhall find acceptance for Chriſt's ſake, than when it is only once at the end of a long continued Prayer, if my own experience, and that of wiſer Men do not deceive me.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, for <hi>Fervency,</hi> we have great help alſo, having nothing to do but to apply our minds to earneſtneſs in praiſing God and praying to him, no need of attending to hear what is ſpoken that we may judge whether it be fit for us to joyn in it or not: and when we know the Prayers before-hand, we can joy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with the Miniſter and Congregation, though w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hear not every word that is read. And the <hi>briefneſs of the Prayers,</hi> being compoſed of ſuch weighty and comprehenſive Expreſſions helps more to <hi>true Fervency</hi> than <hi>long Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> though the Novelty and Variety may more work on <hi>Mens fancies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then thirdly, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Fellowſhip o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Spirit is hereby aſſiſted: I mean that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Fellowſhip which that Spirit of Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hath conſtituted by whom <hi>we are all bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into one Body, and made to drink in to one Spirit,</hi> and ſo are obliged to all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Concord and Agreement both external and internal: For firſt, We agree with the Saint of all Ages in <hi>this, That the publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb facs="tcp:185082:19"/>of God is to be adminiſtred by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Form, and not by the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the Adminiſtrator:</hi> For I cannot underſtand that either the Jewiſh Church or the Chriſtian did ever adminiſter their publick Worſhip in any other way (except what thoſe Perſons did who were divinely inſpired, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were among the Jews, and in the firſt Ages of the Church, who therefore were ſaid to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy when they uttered ſuch excellent Pſalms or Prayers <hi>Extempore:</hi>) of which this is a ſufficient demonſtration to me, That in the Jewiſh Synagogues all things at this day are adminiſtred by Forms, and in all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches (that have not been accounted Enthuſiaſtical) the ſame Way was ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; or at leaſt, none can deny that it now is ſo in all the Chriſtian World, except thoſe <hi>Congregations,</hi> united in ſome odd Opinions, that do ſeparate from the Body of Chriſtians; the only conſiderable Body of theſe, that ever admitted the other Way of Adminiſtration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Scots</hi> formerly, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the late Diſtractions: but on many accounts that Admiſſion cannot be eſteemed an orderly Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or excuſe them from Schiſm, though it were by the prevailing Party. Now ſince it hath ſcarce ever been known, in Matters ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, and of long cuſtom, that great Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been made, but with great Oppoſitions
<pb facs="tcp:185082:20"/>and Commotions; I conclude, that if, in the beginning of the Jewiſh Worſhip in their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, or of the Chriſtian Worſhip in the publick Aſſemblies, Prayers had been ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed to be made in the <hi>Extempore Way</hi> (except by inſpired Perſons, as before) that that Way could not have been altered ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally as it was, to the uſe of Forms, and yet we have no notice of the ſame either in Hiſtory or by Tradition. But ſecondly, not only in that we uſe a Form, but in that we uſe ſuch Forms wherein we have the moſt Communion with other Chriſtians that is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in the very words we ſpeak; we uſe <hi>the Pſalms of David,</hi> which as they have ever been a part of the Publick Worſhip of <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo alſo of <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> we uſe alſo that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Form the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> which hath been uſed very anciently, and received of abundance of Churches into their publick Liturgy; ſo the three <hi>Creeds,</hi> and the <hi>Collects</hi> before the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles and Goſpels; and the <hi>Gloria Patri;</hi> and moſt parts of our Service are made up of the moſt approved and generally received Forms of Prayer that could be found, with accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to the preſent time.</p>
            <p>3dly, In the uſe of the Common-Prayer, we have Communion moſt fully with the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to whom we are united under one Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which we call the <hi>Church of</hi> England)
<pb facs="tcp:185082:20"/>and with all of that Congregation we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently joyn with in publick Worſhip: whereas in the other Way we have no certain Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion but only with the Miniſter, becauſe we are not ſure that any one in the Congregation approves of all he ſays, (nor it may be can we neither) and it is poſſible the Miniſter himſelf may ſpeak that, for want of premeditation, which he, on ſecond thoughts, may not approve himſelf. So that there cannot be ſo full Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Spirit in that Way as in ours.</p>
            <p>Theſe things I have thought fit to hint, to beget a good Opinion in the minds of Men, of our eſtabliſhed Order for the publick Worſhip of God. But I would not be thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe any that have a true love to God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to honour and glorifie him in ſuch a Way of Worſhip as they think moſt acceptable to him, what Miſtakes ſoever Miſinformation and Prejudices of Education and Converſes may ſubject them unto. And I hope thoſe that differ from me, will not reproach my fervent deſire to promote Piety in the Way I beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and that which I am many ways oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to chuſe before any other. And if what I have written would perſwade them to make a honeſt trial, (not by ſtanding at gaze to ſee what we do, or ſitting by as unconcerned in the Worſhip we offer to God by the Common-Prayer, while they only wait for the Preacher
<pb facs="tcp:185082:21"/>they deſire to hear, but) by joyning heartily with us, according to the Advices of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; I do not doubt but they would ſoon leave wondering at my fervency in this Way. But if ſome ſhould, through miſguided Zeal, or for the Intereſts of their Party, fall foul on me for commending what they ſeek by all means to deprave, I am content to ſuffer as my Saviour did, while <hi>the Reproaches of thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach God</hi> (in condemning what by the Laws of Nature, and Examples in Scripture, he approves) <hi>fall upon me.</hi> And if thoſe, that approve this Way of Worſhip, be made hereby the more fervent and devout in attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereupon, I ſhall rejoyce in my Labours and Sufferings for their ſakes. And I hope they will be ſo, when they conſider, that in this Way, Devotion is not ſubject to be abuſed by the ſubtilty of ill Men (as it hath been by ſuch on both ſides that differ from us;) that here is no Diſcouragement given to the Weak and Baſhful, (by exemplifying a Way of Devotion that is above their reach) nor any Temptation to the Bold and Self-conceited to aſpire to things too high for them, to their own ſhame, and to the diſturbance of the Church: That therein nothing but Principles of Truth (that tend to Piety, Charity, Obedience to Superiours, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Moderation, and Peaceableneſs among our ſelves) are poſſible to be inſinuated into our
<pb facs="tcp:185082:21"/>minds: That hereby we ſhall be greatly aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Holy Meditations, (while our minds will he ſtored with abundance of excellent matter for the ſame) and in educating our Children re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly, in keeping our Families in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Order, and performing the Worſhip belonging to the ſame; and the many other great benefits that we ſhall experience in a devout attendance on the daily Service of God in publick appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Church; by which conſiderations they will alſo be more confirmed in their love hereunto, and excited to become <hi>examples to others,</hi> who will be more effectually drawn to their Duty, by obſerving the devout and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent practice of this Way of Piety, than by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputations about it. And it ſeems to me, that nothing is more like to preſerve this Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the deſigns of its Enemies on both hands, than ſuch exemplary frequency of Attendance and fervency of true Devotion in thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs themſelves the Children thereof: The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of which is the Deſign of the enſuing Advice both to <hi>Readers</hi> and <hi>People.</hi>

               <p>WHile this Sheet was Printing, I was told by a Friend, that he heard the Learned Dr. <hi>Beveridge</hi> (in a Sermon on <hi>Titus</hi> 2.12. <hi>March</hi> 26.) declare, That the import of the word <hi>Worſhip,</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing Honour and Reſpect by bowing
<pb facs="tcp:185082:22"/>the Head and Shoulders; and that this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as it had anciently been uſed in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Offices to ſignifie our Adoration of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, ſo it is moſt fit and decent in the Exerciſes of Religion now. I was much pleaſed that the Judgment of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Perſon, publickly declared, juſt at the coming out of this Book, (wich I am ſure he had not the leaſt knowledge or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of) gave countenance to my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking in this Preface.</p>
               <p>Since that, I hearing the ſaid Doctor read Prayers at one of the <hi>Lent</hi>-Sermons at his Church, it ſeemed to me ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Exemplification of what I adviſe in the Book, that I might ſeem to have learnt all from his practice (though I never heard him before). And I have great hope, that the Example of one ſo eminently Pious and Learned, of ſo excellent a Temper, and ſuch unwearied Labours in the Miniſtry, may do more toward introducing Seriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Reverence in Divine Worſhip, than theſe Papers can do themſelves: wherefore I have ventured (without his knowledge) to propoſe his Example in conjunction with my Endeavours; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly begging his pardon, if he be offended to have his Name mentioned by ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a Pen.</p>

               <p>HE that will perform this Service as he ought, muſt firſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with true Devotion in his Mind and Spirit.</p>
               <p>Two things are needful for the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this: Firſt, <hi>That the Expreſſion of Devotion is a neceſſary Part of Worſhip.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>That it will be difficult for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to make ſuch Expreſſion, if he have not real Devotion in himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt, I ſhall only obſerve, That it is the very Nature of Publick Worſhip, to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:185082:23"/>be an outward Expreſſion of ſuch affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Souls as are due unto God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; and ſuch an Expreſſion as is moſt unto his Honour, and our own and others Edification. This, I think, no Man will deny. And for that reaſon our Liturgy for this Worſhip is fitted to expreſs a great humility and fervency in ſupplicating the Divine Majeſty, as the Spring and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all our Comfort; and a great joy and exultancy in extolling his Greatneſs, and praiſing his Goodneſs, as the Perfection of our Felicity; and alſo to be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with actions ſuitable thereunto. And he that reads the Prayers with a rambling Haſt, without ſuch due expreſſions of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in the manner of his Speech and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, quite alters the nature of the thing, and ſpoils the deſign of it.</p>
               <p>Every Man of any ſence, can diſcern the Indecency of reading ſuch words as <hi>[Lord have mercy upon us, Chriſt have mercy upon us, Lord have mercy upon us,]</hi> with ſuch a manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as ſignifies but little Devotion and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency of Mind. And ſo they may alſo of ſaying the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> and <hi>Te Deum,</hi> &amp;c without ſuch cheerfulneſs of Speech, and reverent Acts of Adoration as become the ſame. Neither can we think, that we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:185082:23"/>God by any words we ſpeak, if we do not appear fervous and devout in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the ſame: nor will it at all edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ourſelves or others. For words do not work here as Spells and Charms, but as rational Inſtruments that ſignifie the belief and affections of our Souls; which they cannot do, but by being ſo pronounced, and accompanied with fit actions as aforeſaid. So that upon theſe reaſons, the Reader is obliged to the expreſſion of Devotion in his performance of this Service.</p>
               <p>But beſides, he that is careleſs in making ſuch expreſſion of Devotion in reading the Prayers, doth very much to prevent the Converſion of Infidels and Papiſts, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Nonconformity of all kind of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts, and to encourage the Prophane in their Neglect to attend theſe Sacred Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
               <p>To explain this, I muſt intreat the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to conſider, That notwithſtanding the Confuſion of Tongues, there is one Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Language underſtood by all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, high and low, the ignorant as well as the learned: And thoſe that know not the meaning of the words we ſpeak, or can well perceive whether we ſpeak Sence or Nonſence, yet by this can give account of what we ſay or do, as to the general
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:185082:24"/>tendency thereof. And this Language con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the Tone of our Words, and Mode of our Actions; by theſe they know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Man means love or hatred, anger or good pleaſure, honour or contempt, in common converſation: and ſo they may do alſo in the matter of Religion, they know by theſe, whether a Man, being in the Church, means the Adoration of a God, or a phantaſtick Obſervation of Perſons or Things there preſent; whether he means <hi>a natural delight</hi> in exerciſing his Gifts and natural Powers, and in attending to the Muſick of Words, Voices, or Inſtruments, (for there is no great difference, if no more be meant) or a <hi>ſpiritual employment of his Mind upon God, and the things of Religion, as his chiefeſt Joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this kind of Language, (for ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               <p>All Nations, according to that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which naturally they have of this, have inſtituted and practiſed ſuch Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of their Honour and Reſpect unto the God they worſhipped; and the more the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have declined from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of true Piety, the more they have endeavoured to keep up the reputation of

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:185082:32"/>is ſo ſtrong, that all the powers of Reaſon can ſcarce overcome it; for elſe it were impoſſible but that thoſe Men who are exceeding grave and intent in the Prayer they make themſelves, ſhould ramble at ſuch a rate when they come to conclude with that our Lord and Maſter hath made for them; and that they who in all Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of our Church, would have none to want that Prayer which is the ſum and ſubſtance of all our Prayers, yet ſhould have leſs of Gravity and Devotion in the repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of that, than any of the reſt. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but impute this to an ill habit that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Men get in their Childhood, in this matter of ſaying the Lord's Prayer; and upon account hereof, I make it my ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Requeſt to Parents, and eſpecially thoſe of the Female Sex, (who have uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the charge of hearing their Children ſay their Prayers) that they will teach them, and often call upon them to ſay de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately and diſtinctly what they ſpeak in this Holy Office, but eſpecially the <hi>Lord's Prayer:</hi> the want of this care, cauſeth moſt Men, yea, Miniſters, to have ſo ill a delivery, that it is very prejudicial to themſelves and others, and a diſhonour to the Holy Offices they perform, and a great hindrance to Edification, eſpecially in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:185082:32"/>Miniſters. And 'tis this that would ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon their tender Years with a ſence of God and Religion, which would never go out. Some Veſſels never looſe the ſavour of that which firſt of all is put into them, eſpecially if it ſtand long; and if Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were firſt taught a right manner of performing their Devotions, and kept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to it while under the Tuition of their Mother, they would retain the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it through their whole lives. And we ſee by ſad experience, the neglect of this not only is cauſe of the habitual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect fore-mentioned, but betrays them to ſome ill Habits that make them a Grief to their Parents all their days. And I have hope, if Mothers were but conſcious of their Duty herein, it would make them more wary of giving way to theſe frothy or froward humours, and that inordinate concern for little things, which indiſpoſe them for the ſame, and more willing to put on the Ornaments of the inward Man of the Heart, which inables them thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, by giving them that reverence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect with their Children without which it can never be effected.</p>
               <p>I hint this, 1. Becauſe (as the welfare of Mankind depends very much on the good Education of Children, ſo) their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:185082:33"/>good Education will be moſt eſſectually begun in the well performance of this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for in teaching them to ſay the <hi>Lord's Prayer</hi> devoutly, they will have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to diſcourſe to them of the Glory and Preſence of God, of the Awe and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence we muſt have for him; of his all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſing Providence, and our Dependance on him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the Principles of all Goodneſs; and alſo of the great Indear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Bleſſed Saviour, and of the excellency of his Perſon who taught this Prayer; whereby they will be diſpoſed to true Chriſtianity; and this foundation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid, it will be eaſie to build them up in all Vertues.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe I believe, that as Formality hath for the moſt part its beginning from the ill ſaying this Prayer, ſo it is moſt like to have its ending by our learning to ſay it aright; and he that can be devout as he ought in this, will be able to perform all acts of Devotion as becomes him. 'Tis the Opinion of wiſe Men, That Chriſt and his Church hath therefore thought better to teach us to pray, by preſcribing us Forms, than by giving us a Directory for the Matter of Prayer, and leaving the Compoſure to ourſelves, becauſe no labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Exerciſe of the Memory or Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:185082:33"/>ſhould hinder the free and vigorous Exerciſe of Devotion; and that theſe Forms are uſually brief, (except thoſe for Faſts, which for a peculiar reaſon are lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) leſt that vigilant and erect attention of mind, which in Prayer is very neceſſary, ſhould be waſted or dulled through conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance if the Prayers were few and long. (as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> hath it out of St. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>) Now when Men pervert theſe ends, and becauſe they are not <hi>neceſſitated</hi> to be intent, by being put to ſtudy their Prayers juſt when they make them, or to remember what they ſtudied before, therefore they will take no care to be intent at all, but ſay their Prayers as a Hireling doth his Work, as faſt as they can, that they may be at leiſure for that which they take more pleaſure in. And becauſe they have theſe brief Prayers very perfect, their Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the more imperfect; this is a very unworthy requital of the Care of Chriſt and his Church: and how juſtly may ſuch Perſons be given up to <hi>ſuch Errours</hi> as have drawn many into Fanaticiſm? as, <q>That Forms of Prayer are the bane of Devotion: The <hi>Lord's Prayer</hi> is no Form: The way of Extempore Prayer is the only acceptable Service of God: And to pray by the Liturgy, or other Forms,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:185082:34"/>is unlawful;</q> and ſuch-like.</p>
               <p>Let me therefore once more intreat the care of Parents in this matter, that they will, firſt by their own Example, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Prayer moſt diſtinctly, gravely, and devoutly, and in the moſt reverent poſture in their Family-Worſhip, and then by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction ſuitable to the Capacities of their Children, and by the exerciſe of Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Authority, bring them once to a good performance in ſaying this Divine Prayer by themſelves, (which might be eaſily done if Men had a mind to it) and then bring them to Church with them, and make them joyn with the Congregation in that Prayer firſt and in a devout po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and with a diſtinct and audible voice, (and this they can be taught very young) and this will beget a deſire in them to joyn in the reſt, a diligence in learning to read, and a good pronunciation in all things: and this their concern to make their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren devout, would prevent another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern (which in the Church ſeems very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent) and I mention it at the requeſt of one who is much offended thereby, which is, a concern that their Childrens Hoods and Cloaths ſit in the beſt manner, and be kept clean; which makes them more buſie about theſe things, even in the face of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:185082:34"/>Congregation, than about their Prayers: which I hope will ſeem to themſelves ſo unfit, when they conſider it, that a word will perſwade them to reform it. But to return to my purpoſe.</p>

               <p>And here I ſhall humbly offer to the conſideration of the Governours of Choires in Cathedral Churches, the Reformation of a great Diſorder, that I ſuppoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the neglect of ſomething of this kind. I have obſerved myſelf, and heard many complain, (ſome out of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, others in Reproach of our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) that the Singing-boys are ſo rude and indecent in their Behaviour, that it makes that Service ſeem more like a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Divertiſement, than the ſolemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Almighty GOD: The occaſion whereof ſeems to me, to be the neglect of due care, that all the Singing-men and Boys know before-hand what is to be ſung, and have it, every one, turned down rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in their Books: for the chief occaſion of their talking to the Singing-men, and among themſelves, is about this matter; and their being ſo uſed to talk in the midſt of the Prayers, begets a profane Spirit in them, and is ſuch an excuſe for them, that they are ready to talk and laugh together, on other accounts, in the very face of the Biſhops and the Maſters of the Church:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:185082:36"/>which hath given great Offence to many; and, I believe, the ſuffering this hath been one great cauſe of the Contempt of that Service among the common People, which makes the Reformation thereof the more needful. I was lately told of an Order in ſome <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches, (whoſe Service conſiſts chiefly in Singing the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> to the praiſe and glory of God; and Songs of Love and Honour to our bleſſed Saviour, compoſed by excellent Perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, for which Service they have Aſſemblies twice a day) and it is this: <hi>That all may know what is to be ſung, there is a Table hung up at the entrance of the Church, where it is written down what Pſalms and Songs are appointed for the day; and the People (coming early to Church) go firſt to this place, and take notice what they are to ſing, and look it out ready before the Service begins.</hi> Such an Order in our Choires would prevent the Indecency fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, as alſo the Boys running up and down with Books to tell what Anthem is ſung; which is alſo very indecent.</p>
               <p>Neither is the care of Cleanneſs and Neatneſs both of Body and Garments to be neglected. The reaſon of the Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Laws for the Waſhings and curious Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Prieſts, <hi>(which was for the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:185082:37"/>beauty and glory of the Worſhip) they were to perform)</hi> ſeems to me to infer thus much at leaſt, That thoſe who adminiſter Holy Things, ſhould avoid all offenſive Naſtineſs and Slovinglineſs, and appear before God and the Congregation as becomes the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the moſt Holy God, and of that Church which Chriſt deſigns to be <hi>without ſpot or wrinkle:</hi> and eſpecially in admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring thoſe things which are more ſacred and glorious.</p>
               <p>The obſervation of the great proneneſs of <hi>poor Readers</hi> to neglect <hi>this,</hi> hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded me of the convenient Inſtitution of the <hi>Surplice,</hi> to teach them Cleanlineſs, and cover their defects therein; which yet will not prevail with many to keep Themſelves clean, nor That neither.</p>
               <p>Thus have I hinted ſuch things as ſeem to make for the Solemnity and Efficacy of Divine Service; and the contrary where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, I have either obſerved myſelf, or heard others complain to be indecent: which I humbly offer to the conſideration of thoſe that are to read Publick Prayers. And I hope they will be moved the more to the exerciſe of a ſerious conſideration in this matter, when they ſee the People do take notice what is decent and what indecent in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:185082:37"/>their performance, and concern themſelves as much to have the Prayers well read, as to have excellent Sermons preached. And upon ſuch conſideration, they will find far better Rules to direct themſelves, than my Pen hath offered.</p>
               <p>And I might uſe ſome Arguments to perſwade all <hi>Readers</hi> to attend unto ſuch moſt ſerious conſideration of this Advice; but I ſhall mention only this for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion: that every one of them did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare (at their Ordination) <hi>their belief that they were inwardly moved by the Holy Ghoſt to take on them this Office and Miniſtry to ſerve God, for the promoting his glory, and edifying his People.</hi> For their undertaking ſuch an Office, for ſuch ends, at the motion of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is the beſt Argument that can be imagined to perſwade them to ſuch a performance as may reach thoſe ends which the Holy Ghoſt is ſo much concerned to promote; becauſe they muſt apprehend it a dreadful thing to fruſtrate the deſign of that Almighty Spirit, (as much as in them lies) by their negligence and unfaithfulneſs, and a moſt happy and comfortable thing to co-operate with him by a right perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that honourable Office to which he hath advanced them.</p>

               <p>HE that will perform this Service as he ought, muſt be duely prepar'd for the ſame. Now theſe Preparations are either Moral or Natural. The Moral are, 1. That we rightly underſtand, and well conſider what we go about; that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our Minds to ſuch a frame as becomes <hi>the Worſhip and Service of the moſt High God</hi> and of his Son Jeſus Chriſt; and ſo that we may perform it as <hi>in the Fellowſhip and Communion of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> He that thinks of nothing elſe at his going to Church, but of hearing ſome celebrated Miniſter, one that hath a rare <hi>Gift of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> or <hi>excellent Method in Preaching,</hi> where he ſhall have his Mind ſtirr'd up to good Thoughts, or his Fancy pleaſed with curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Notions, his Doubts reſolved in hard points of Divinity, and himſelf aſſiſted to defend his Opinions and Party againſt their Opponents, and ſuch-like things: I ſay, he that hath only ſuch thoughts at his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Church, will never concern himſelf to be ſo ſerious and compoſed, and to put
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:185082:38"/>on ſuch a heavenly frame of mind, as he that thinks <hi>he is going to do the work of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; to adore and worſhip that Eternal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that is enthron'd in the Heavens, and that Lamb of God who hath taken away the ſins of the World, who is in the midſt of that Throne; To celebrate their Praiſes, to make our common Supplications to God through his Son: and to witneſs our ſubjection to his Laws de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by immediate inſpiration of his bleſſed Spirit; and to act and exerciſe the Graces of thy Spirit in holy Communion one with another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as this is evident from the nature of the thing, ſo is it apparent in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects among Men.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:185082:39"/>of ſlightneſs and irreverence in approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Sacred Offices, (eſpecially in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, where it is moſt indecent) and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching us for what we do out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of our Duty, the reaſon where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> one thing, (omitted before) <hi>viz.</hi> That it is very helpful to ſuch compoſure for this Service, That all perſons do endeavour to be at Church before the Prayers begin, that they may more ſedately approach the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Preſence, and perform the Reverence due to the moſt high God; and, without any diſturbance to themſelves or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, take their place in the Church; and compoſe themſelves by Prayer and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation for theſe holy Duties, as before Certainly, it is a great advantage to a right
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:185082:44"/>performance, that we do this: for when we come, ſuddenly and haſtily, from our world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Buſineſſes, to ſacred Offices, it is hard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s a mighty help to a right performance: Then we may with more freedom make our private Prayer to God for his gracious acceptance and aſſiſtance; and thoſe who are offended when we do it in midſt of the Service, can find no fault with us for doing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t before it begin: And we ſhall alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, as much as may be, the diſturbing the Congregation by clattering of Pews, and by diſordering others to get to our places, and calling the <hi>Sexton</hi> from ſerving God to wait on us to open our Pew: And indeed, I have thought that ſort of Men very unhappy in this, that they can have little time and compoſure to attend this Holy Office upon that very account; which every one ſhould prevent as far as they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an; conſidering they have ſouls to ſave as
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:185082:45"/>well as we. But yet let not this, nor any thing elſe, ſo prevent thoſe who are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily hindred from coming early, that they come not at all; it is better to come but to the Bleſſing, than wholly to forbear; God accepts the will for the deed, when we can do no more, (and ſo he doth a part for the whole) and by declaring our wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to do what we can, we keep up a reverence for the Prayers, and gain our ſelves a ſhare with the reſt of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in all the Bleſſings ſought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>There is one thing that I would adviſe, as a help to this our coming early, which is, that a certain time be fixed by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter for the beginning of Prayers, for then every one can the better order his buſineſs, and watch the time that he may be ready; and where it is ſo, I know that Men of great buſineſs may find a time to attend the daily Prayers: I have ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples near me that I can ſcarce forbear to name, but without leave I dare not. And I wiſh withal my heart that while Prayers are read daily in ſome places in this City, the Pariſhes where they are would take care for a Bell of a clear ſound, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly hung, and would alſo cauſe it to be rung ſome conſiderable time before
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:185082:45"/>they begin, which will be very helpful in this caſe: and this would prevent an Abuſe which I have obſerved in moſt Churches that have Prayers twice a day, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that the Sextons are ſo careleſs and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, that the Church-doors are not ſo much as opened when the Clock ſtrikes the hour appointed for Prayers, ſo that many that, out of Devotion, or by reaſon of the difference of Clocks, come a little to ſoon are fain to wait a great while, at the Church-door for entrance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The natural Preparations are, <hi>An ability to read diſtinctly that which we are to read, and alſo to ſay perfectly by heart the daily Pſalms and Hymns; that ſo we may perform our part with the better grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis certainly a thing moſt evident to any that will conſider it, that what is to be done in the ſight and preſence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and eſpecially when it is to be done, moſt immediately, for his Glory and Honour, I ſay that it ſhould be done in the moſt excellent manner that is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; and therefore it will need no proof, to thoſe that believe what I have already written on that Subjects, that this which I adviſe is a great and moſt concerning Duty. And I the rather inſiſt on it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have obſerved that many who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:185082:46"/>to be great Approvers of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer, and of all the Orders of our Church, do yet ſeldom or never read their part of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> or joyn in the Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the <hi>daily Hymns and Reſponſes,</hi> as they are ordered: which I impute to their great careleſneſs in thoſe preparations: and that many who do what is required to be done, yet do it ſo ill, that it is apparent they want ſome excitation to their Duty hereabout.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore intreat all that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective herein, to employ their leiſure hours to practiſe a more perfect and punctual way of Reading; which will be a thing of credit and uſe to them, otherwiſe as well as here. I have ſometimes been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, when Men of good Quality and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates have taken upon them to read ſome Pamphlet in a Coffee-houſe; but read at ſuch a pitiful rate, that a Man could ſcarce make ſence of it, or be ever the wiſer for hearing it: which is a reproach to them among wiſe Men; for whatever the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of their Education have been, it might eaſily have been ſupplied by their own diligence, if an inordinate love of Company and other Divertiſements did not make them, too much, to decline profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Retirements.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:185082:46"/>
               <p> And I would intreat all Parents and Maſters to conſider the obligation that is upon them in this reſpect, and to look that their Children and Servants do the ſame: We owe not onely our ſelves, but all ours, to the honour and ſervice of Almighty God; And if Children were taught, as they ſhould be, their duty to worſhip and praiſe God in the publick Aſſemblies, and encouraged therein by the example of their Elders, it would be a mighty Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to perſwade them to learn the moſt diſtinct and graceful way of Reading. I have been much pleaſed to ſee the good ſucceſs of this care in ſome Parents that are well affected to the Common Prayer, whoſe Children read their part of the Pſalms with a better grace than many when grown to be Men can do: And when theſe do attain to a perfection here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, it will beget in them a great delight in that heavenly Exerciſe, and make them love to attend the Prayers; and this doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs will be a mighty Antidote againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs and Schiſm, and both plant and root in our minds that Doctrine whence a holy Life cannot but ſpring.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That being prepared as before, we ſhould endeavour our ſelves to perform our part of this Service in the beſt manner we are able.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Service, and the <hi>Abſolution</hi> which he give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> them after the <hi>General Confeſſion;</hi> the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments</hi> alſo, and many other thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> appointed for the Miniſter alone; which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by all wiſe men held very improper and indecent.</p>
               <p>The Church indeed hath ordered ſome things to be ſaid after the Miniſter, with great advice. As, 1. The <hi>General Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> wherein we ſolemnize that <hi>Repentance</hi> that gives us admittance into the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſtate, that which makes all our Services acceptable to God. And there is this great advantage in the conjunction of all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (and that with the Voice as well as the Heart,) That the profeſſing of our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in that manner, hath all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that may make it ſatisfactory and obliging, (at leaſt as far as the Church can provide in the caſe.) Therein every one doth as it were accuſe, judge, and condemn himſelf before God and the whole Congregation, for ſins contained
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:185082:47"/>under the general heads therein mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (the particular inſtances whereof are onely fit to be repeated in ſecret Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God himſelf) and if he do it ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, with a Devotion ſuitable to the Words, it is to me a more ſatisfactory ſign of penitence, than the enlarged Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions uſed in the other Way; wherein ſome, (to ſeem fervent, or to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo) run into the enumeration of ſins beyond due meaſures, being, as I think, beyond what the Congregation in general can be ſuppoſed (though Chriſtians of a ſort inferiour to themſelves, at leaſt in their own judgment) to be ordinarily conſcious that they have been guilty in. And 'tis alſo obliging; for this ſhould be a mighty argument againſt returning to ſin, when we have ſolemnly confeſſed our folly and guilt therein before God and the Congregation: For having as it were called God and Man to witneſs the truth and ſincerity of our Repentance, it will be a high aggravation of our careleſneſs, if we ſuffer our ſelves eaſily to be drawn to ſin again, and that either in omitting our Duty, or commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Iniquity in any kind: and it will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage every good man to <hi>watch and pray, leſt he ſhould enter into temptation,</hi> and be hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the ſins for which he hath ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned himſelf.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:185082:48"/>
               <p> The 2d. is the <hi>Lord's Prayer;</hi> which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it teacheth the forming of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and deſires of our Souls unto the moſt excellent order, and raiſing them by degrees to the higheſt perfection, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it comprehends the heads of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is to be ſought by us at the hands of God, and that with greateſt brevity and plainneſs) it is neceſſary to be learned of all, even from their firſt attainment of the uſe of Reaſon and Speech; And this the Church cannot better provide for, than by engaging them always to ſay it after the Miniſter: and beſides, it implies a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Chriſtian Unity, and a renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of all Hereſies and Schiſms as far as we know them: And we do the greater honour to God and our bleſſed-Saviour, in that we repeat that Prayer in the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and triumphant manner we are able; and every one, by a great fervency and devotion therein, doth moſt effectually edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Brethren.</p>
               <p>The 3d. is, the Repetition of the <hi>Creeds;</hi> a thing ſo uſeful to implant the brief ſum of Chriſtian Doctrine in the memories of all, and to declare our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon joy and exultancy in the belief and profeſſion of thoſe truths upon which the hopes of our common Salvation is built,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:185082:48"/>as alſo to aſſiſt the production and growth of the bleſſed fruits and effects of our Faith, by a daily cheriſhing the Root; which we do by this ſolemn profeſſion, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed conſideration that we ſhould joyn with it: I ſay, a thing, in theſe reſpects (and many other) that may be thought ſo uſeful, that all good men muſt needs commend the wiſdom of the Church in ordering the ſame.</p>
               <p>Theſe are all of that kind that I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the daily Service, (to which this diſcourſe chiefly relates) and in theſe it is very commendable to ſay after the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: but now, if thoſe that are naturally loquacious, finding a delight in ſaying what they ſhould, remit the Exerciſe of their conſideration ſo far, as to ſay that they ſhould not; here is a fault that ought to be amended; and I am ſure, on ſerious thoughts, they that love our Prayers will freely incline ſo to do. For they will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perceive, how indecent it is for them to ſay after the Miniſter where he is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſpeak to them; either by way of Exhortation, Conſolation, or Admonition; and that the People ſhould abſolve the Prieſt, as much as the Prieſt abſolves them; this hath great abſurdity, and on that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration will, I hope, readily be reformed.</p>

And as I have known, in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, many that uſed the way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempory Prayer before their Sermon, only to humour the people, when in their own judgment they much prefer'd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant uſe of a well-compoſed Form; ſo I know ſome now, who do read the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers very faſt (and that beyond what the ſolemnity of the matter can bear) only (as I charitably hope) becauſe they ſee the people ſo ſubject to this diſorder of running before them (which they know not how to remedy otherwiſe) or becauſe they ſee ſome hate to be long at Church.

               <p>And again, thoſe that have ſo accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themſelves to ſpeak before the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, are at a far greater loſs to ſay ſuch <hi>New Prayers,</hi> or <hi>Penitential Pſalms,</hi> which are ſometimes ordered on Faſts, to be ſaid with the Miniſter, than thoſe who are rightly practiſed in the regular way, for that makes it eaſie to ſay, and that very decently, ſuch things after the Miniſter as we never heard before. For if we attend well unto the main of the Sentence which we are to repeat we ſhall be able to gueſs at the Concluſion; ſo that we need not ſtay till he hath quite done before we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, but may hear the laſt while we ſpeak the firſt ſo as to ſay all right, and may come up with him in the concluſion, as is moſt decent. And this would make much for the ſolemn performance of the Service on extraordinary times; wherein now, for

It is evident, that Life without pleaſure is an empty name, and little more deſirable than Death: <hi>David</hi> lamenting, in his own perſon, the deplorable Miſeries to which Man in his beſt ſtate is now ſubject, asks the queſtion, <hi>Wherefore God hath made all men for nought?</hi> and yet the Apoſtle tells of ſome who <hi>li-lived in pleaſure,</hi> that they were <hi>dead while they lived;</hi> hence we may conclude, that Man is a Creature capable of two ſorts of Pleaſure, Mental, and Carnal; and that theſe do for the moſt part militate againſt each other: and if carnal Pleaſures pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, and get the poſſeſſion of our Life, we are ſaid to be <hi>dead</hi> in reſpect of our minds and ſpiritual part; but if the Delights of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:185082:54"/>the Mind once take place, and become our Employment, then the Body is ſaid to be <hi>dead, dead by reaſon of ſin</hi> as <hi>the ſpirit is life becauſe of righteouſneſs.</hi> So that it is of mighty avail, to cheriſh theſe ſpiritual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and depreſs thoſe that are carnal; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in the beginning of our life; as that upon which the Happineſs of our whole Life depends.

               <p>You are alſo well to conſider the inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe <hi>Sentences,</hi> by his reading the <hi>Exhortation</hi> following; in the mean time reflecting on yourſelf with a due remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of your particular ſins, that you may be the better prepared to accompany him, with a pure Heart and humble Voice, in the <hi>General Confeſſion</hi> following.

And we ought ſo to ſpeak in repeating the ſame after the Miniſter, that we thereby expreſs, that we verily believe ourſelves to be guilty (in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular inſtances) of many ſins contained under the ſeveral Heads there mentioned; and that we are heartily ſorry for the ſame, and earneſtly implore pardoning Mercy and Forbearance, and to be reſtored to God's Grace and Favour, truſting to his Promiſes made to us in Chriſt; and with no leſs earneſtneſs deſire the aſſiſtance of God's Grace, to inable us to live better for the future. This faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful endeavour to appear as humble Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents before God and the Congregation, will ſuppreſs the workings of <hi>Pride and Self-conceit</hi> (the Parent of all Vice) and ſtrengthen <hi>Humility,</hi> (the Nurſe of all Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues) and beget that brotherly Love which is founded in true Piety and Humility.</p>
               <p>In attending in the ſame poſture while the Miniſter, as God's Herald, pronounceth <hi>Abſolution and Pardon to the truly penitent that unfeignedly believe the Goſpel;</hi> we ought
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:185082:55"/>to expreſs a great Reverence of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty (from whom he ſpeaks) and alſo the moſt humble Thankfulneſs, and holy Joy for his rich Grace; which Grace is communicated to us by the Stewards of his Myſteries, and cannot be received, in the contempt of their Adminiſtrations whom he hath impowred to diſpence the ſame: And withal, earneſtly begging (according to his Exhortation) that our Faith and Repentance may be aſſiſted by Divine Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation, that we never fail of the ſame Grace, for want of meet diſpoſitions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; nor neglect the improvement thereof when beſtowed, either at preſent or for the future.</p>
               <p>When we have thus prepared ourſelves, we ought, with heavenly Joy, and great Fervency, to joyn with the Miniſter and Congregation in repeating that Divine Prayer which our Saviour taught. The beginning whereof being Euchariſtical; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſuch Petitions as are for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate honour and glory of God; it is fit, that we lift up our hands and eyes to Heaven, when with our voices we declare our joy in God; and exultancy in his Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. In the reſt we ſupplicate things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for ourſelves; therefore we ſhould expreſs greateſt humility, in bowing our
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:185082:56"/>Heads and Bodies towards the Earth; as unworthy to ask ſo great things, of ſo great a Majeſty; and ſpeak we ſhould alſo with more lowly and humble Voices in repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame. Until, returning, in the Doxology, to the acknowledgment of his Paternal Government, which inclines him; of his Power, which enables him, and of his Glory, which engages him to be ſo good to his Creatures; and eſpecially to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; we again lift up our hearts and hands to Heaven, and repeat the ſame chearful Voices.</p>
               <p>After this, we paſs to that high and heavenly work of praiſing God, in the Pſalms and Hymns following: Now tho' it were the work for which chiefly we were made, and the excellent power of Speech given us; and that to which (while we continued innocent and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py) our mouth was ſtill opened, and we had freedom and power to perform the ſame; yet now ſin and ſorrow, guilt and fear, cares and vexations, have even made us dumb to God's Praiſes, and diſabled us for due celebration hereof: Therefore in this reſpect we ought moſt devoutly to joyn with the Miniſter in the Reſponſe following the Lord's Prayer, <hi>Lord open thou our Mouths, And our Lips
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:185082:56"/>ſhall ſhew forth thy praiſe. O God make ſpeed to ſave us, O Lord, make haſt to help us.</hi> And while we ſeek his Grace, we ſhould uſe our own endeavours to open our own Mouths, and lift up our voices, while we ſing his Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and to awaken all our powers, to a cheerful performance of this Service.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> follows; at the repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof we are required to ſtand; a poſture moſt fit in all manner of <hi>Pſalmody,</hi> and when ever we ſpeak or ſing praiſe and glory to God; but eſpecially in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies convened chiefly for that purpoſe. And in pronouncing theſe words of Glory, it would be very indecent to do it in any poſture that is leſs reverent. To ſit, is very offenſive to all that deſire to ſee this Service duely performed. And it is reaſon it ſhould be ſo; for theſe words ſignifie a moſt immediate Addreſs to God, the Ever Bleſſed Trinity in Unity, in the higheſt act of Chriſtian Worſhip; and ſo fitly do they ſerve to the Adoration of the Deity, according to the Faith of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that the Man that doth not expreſs the inward reverence and adoration of his mind, by the devout manner of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing them, and by a fit deportment at that time; gives ſuſpition of ſome defect
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:185082:57"/>in his Chriſtianity, or of ſome miſtake in the way of expreſſing the ſame. And this erect poſture of our Bodies, would mind us to lift up our Hearts, yea, and our Voices too, in giving praiſe and glory unto this Bleſſed Trinity; whereas the other diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us to a defect in both: and therefore, not only to avoid giving offence, but for our own benefit we ſhould obſerve it.</p>
               <p>Being next to proceed to praiſe God by the repetition of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c. the Miniſter (that he may mind us that it is not the ordinary reading thoſe parts of Scripture for inſtruction, but the repeating them as an Office of Praiſe and Solemn Worſhip to Almighty God) I ſay, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter on that account is ordered to ſay, <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord;</hi> and the People to anſwer, <hi>The Lord's Name be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> In hearing and ſaying which words, we muſt endeavour to excite in ourſelves holy deſires to praiſe God, and ſo to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this Exerciſe, as may tend moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly to his Glory and Honour.</p>
               <p>The Pſalm with which we always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at Morning Prayer, is, <hi>O come, let us ſing unto the Lord;</hi> and is moſt fitly choſen, both for mutual provocation to this heavenly Exerciſe, and for inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the reaſons thereof; and withal
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:185082:57"/>to inſinuate that obedience to all God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in the whole courſe of our lives ſhould be conſequent to the adoration and praiſe of God as our God; ſhewing in the concluſion the dreadful danger of not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the <hi>ſame:</hi> which excellent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter requires that we be <hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>intent</hi> in repeating this Pſalm, as that which will prepare and diſpoſe us to be ſo in all the reſt.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>repetition of the Pſalms in courſe</hi> that follows; I have hinted before what is needful in that matter; one thing pray remember, that none ſhould take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to fit in that performance, except conſtrained by bodily infirmity; becauſe ſtanding is ſo much more fit a poſture for the Office of Thankſgiving; and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was counted ſo indecent in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times, that the whole Service was called <hi>Station;</hi> and ſitting is only indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged now in ſome Parts for bodily weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and becauſe of the great decay of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which will not bear ſuch ſtrictneſs.</p>
               <p>After the Pſalms, a <hi>Chapter</hi> is read out of <hi>the Old Teſtament,</hi> that we may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Doctrine of the Creation and Government of the firſt World, its Deſtruction and Reſtitution; the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the MESSIA, and procedure of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:185082:58"/>God's Grace in preparing Men for Him, in, bringing them to Him, and ſaving them by Him, as alſo in the correſpondency of our <hi>Saviour's</hi> Doctrine to that which God of old delivered by his Prophets; his agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Types and Figures of him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, and the accompliſhment of what <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets wrote, <hi>in that which he was, did, and ſuffered:</hi> in ſuch, and many other reſpects, the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof is profitable; and therefore all talking, gazing, and careleſs behaviour (too often ſeen at this time) ſhould be avoided, and we ſhould appear as diligent Auditors of thoſe Divine Oracles.</p>
               <p>The inſtruction therein given us to it, and the reſpite we have had hereby in it, ſhould cauſe us to return with greater joy and cheerfulneſs to this heavenly work of praiſing God. For which, there is next prepared <hi>the Evangelical Hymn TEDE<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>M;</hi> the moſt excellent that ever was compoſed by Man, and ſpeaks as much of Divine Inſpiration as any thing (not acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſuch) ever did: 'tis ſo fitted for Divine Adoration, and apt to excite De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and to miniſter moſt abundantly to the Conſolation of good Chriſtians, that even that alone (methinks) ſhould draw us <hi>to Church,</hi> if not with-held by great obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:185082:58"/>I do therefore moſt earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to you the moſt ſolemn appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the moſt devout acts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the moſt plain, joyful, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner of ſpeaking, and what ever you can think becomes the repetition of thoſe excellent words.</p>
               <p>The Adoration of God, and of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour by the foreſaid Exerciſe, cannot but diſpoſe us to the next, <hi>viz.</hi> the Chapter out of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> which being called New for its excellency and perpetue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty above the Old, and reporting to us ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the wonderful Works of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, their holy and incomparable Doctrine, or perfect and exemplary Lives, cannot be too diligently and reverently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to: And I ſhould think thoſe who have ſtrength of body, would do very commendably in ſtanding up at the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, on the ſame reaſons for which we do ſo at reading the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Then we are ordered to return again to the work of <hi>Praiſing</hi> God; which nothing but Carnality can ever be weary of. And the <hi>Pſalms</hi> here appointed, are ſuch as miniſter moſt fitly to the Joy conceived by hearing the glad tidings of the Goſpel ſent to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (of which we were) as well as to the <hi>Jews;</hi> and therefore to ſhew that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:185082:59"/>we have not <hi>received that Grace in vain</hi> nor heard the Goſpel of it without dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent heed, we ſhould repeat that <hi>Pſalm</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly and joyfully.</p>

                     </gap> mouths to Salvation.</hi>) We therefore, in one poſture and all with our Faces one way, (as indeed it ſhould be, and would be if the Reader did give the example) do with one <hi>mouth</hi> repeat that excellent <hi>Form of ſound Words,</hi> which ſo excellently mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to the ſtedfaſtneſs of our Faith, our rejoycing in Hope, our unity in Love, and cheerfulneſs in the Praiſes of God and our Saviour, that no Man, that conſiders it, could chuſe but ſtand up and bear his part with us; and he that finds no ſpiritual joy and elevation of mind in repeating the <hi>Creed,</hi> can have nothing elſe but a <hi>natural</hi> delight in hearing the moſt excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or raviſhing Prayer: For neither of theſe can have any <hi>Matter</hi> that is more tranſporting; and if it be only the <hi>words</hi> or <hi>paſſion of the Speaker</hi> that affects us, 'tis no <hi>ſpiritual</hi> delight. Let thoſe therefore
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:185082:59"/>take heed, who regard not to honour God, and expreſs the joy of their Faith, by a due performance in this matter.</p>
               <p>After this, we return to the ſolemn Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Prayer;</hi> which that we may perform with mutual Charity, and great Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Miniſter ſalutes the People with that excellent Option, <hi>The Lord be with you:</hi> and they return, <hi>And with thy Spirit.</hi> Which words, ſpoken with the holy affection they ought, are apt to beget ſuch a diſpoſition of mind, as will render the Prayers very acceptable to God, and edifying to one another. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter yet farther (to awaken all the powers of our Souls to this moſt ſerious buſineſs) is to ſay, <hi>Let us pray:</hi> which therefore we ſhould compoſe ourſelves to do with all our might.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Reſponſe</hi> wherewith we begin, <hi>Lord have mercy, Chriſt have mercy, Lord have mercy,</hi> ſerves moſt fitly to aſſiſt this endeavour of great fervency; and being repeated without it, ſeems very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent, and a kind of <hi>vain Repetition:</hi> therefore remember this.</p>
               <p>Then we renew the Repetition of the <hi>Lord's Prayer;</hi> which Prayer certainly is of that excellency, that no Chriſtian ſhould think it too much to uſe it both in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:185082:60"/>and end of this Service. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, this is the very ſum and ſubſtance of all our Prayers; and others are added only for greater ſolemnity, and fuller ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication: And therefore the oftner it is repeated, the more devoutly it ſhould be ſaid, and greater fervency excited by it: of which before.</p>
               <p>To relax a little the great intention of mind that ſhould accompany all our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but eſpecially the Lord's prayer we have that excellent <hi>Reſponſe,</hi> wherein the Miniſter and People exchange ſome devout Ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, <hi>for themſelves, for their Superiours, and for their Brethren:</hi> which as they mix <hi>holy delight with fervency,</hi> ſo they greatly ſtrengthen the Bands of Chriſtian Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>The reſt of the time we ſpend in repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſeveral <hi>Collects;</hi> moſt excellent for the matter, and comprehenſive for the words: In praying for the King and Royal Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for Magiſtrates and Miniſters, the Church and State; all Chriſtians, and all Men; and in giving ſolemn Thanks for God's mercies to us and them: in all which we ſhould ſtrive to preſerve a conſtant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and true devotion of mind: and if, to that end, we accompany the Miniſter with our voice (as many do) it ſhould be
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:185082:60"/>always with ſuch caution as I have expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before; and ſo it may be very uſeful thereunto; and alſo it would make us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in ſaying thoſe Prayers, which may be of great uſe to us in other caſes, beſides that, of our joyning with the Congregation therein. But now if Men having got the faculty of ſaying the Prayers readily by heart, do let their Tongues run before Wits, and ſay faſter than it can be thought they underſtand, or can conſider what they ſay; then they abuſe God's good gifts, and ſhame themſelves, and diſturb others. It was greatly blam'd by the Apoſtle, that ſome of thoſe who had received the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Gift of Tongues, were ſo forward in the uſe of it, as that it hindred their due conſideration of the things they ſpake, and others underſtanding them; for amending whereof, he propoſeth his own example to their imitation, ſaying, <hi>I will pray with the ſpirit,</hi> but yet ſo, as <hi>with the underſtanding alſo;</hi> and I think we may infer ſomething from hence for our inſtruction in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I have taken liberty of ſome repetition and inlargement here, becauſe I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard this Diſorder complained of ſince the firſt Edition of this Book; and many wiſh the Reprinting of it for this very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that it may be lent or given to thoſe,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:185082:61"/>in whom they obſerve this Diſorder, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie their practice herein.</p>
               <p>What I have here diſcourſed ſhews, that I believe this Service to be well ordered to prevent all wandring thoughts, to preſerve a due preſence of mind, to promote pious affections, and to give the beſt entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to true Devotion; and indeed on all theſe accounts I do wonder very much that it is not had in greater eſtimation.</p>
               <p>But Men muſt do their own part, alſo towards this; therefore, I earneſtly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh all Men to avoid ſitting, lolling, leaning, and all indecent poſtures, and to continue kneeling meekly and devoutly, in the whole Performance if they can. And I think Men too apt to plead Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, out of indulgence to the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> which ſhould be taught to ſuffer ſomething for the honour of God, and intereſts of <hi>our Souls,</hi> which have ſuffered a great deal by its pleaſures and paſſions: and I doubt not, the pain we endure to expreſs our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent Adoration of the Almighty in this his Solemn Worſhip, ſhall be accepted of God as a part of Our Mortifications, and of our Conformity to Chriſt and his Church; and no Chriſtian that conſiders the great and moſt dolorous pain where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chriſt offered himſelf in Sacrifice on
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:185082:61"/>the Croſs, can think much to endure ſome little pain, that we may offer our Sacrifices of Prayers and Praiſes with that reverence which becomes us: nor can any Man have that ſence of the adorable Majeſty of the moſt High, when his head and elbows lye on the bench of his ſeat, as when he kneels in an erect poſture with his eyes and hands lift up to Heaven. The actions of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy have a great influence on the Soul; as well as, on the contrary, the Souls affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons move it to act: Beſides the decency of this, which is ſo evident, that I may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Men themſelves in this caſe, as the Apoſtle in another of the ſame nature, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a matter of Indecency in God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) <hi>Judge in yourſelves what is meet.</hi> Can any Man think it fit to ſupplicate the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Majeſty of Heaven and Earth in any but the moſt humble poſture of body, (which with us is Kneeling) or that we ought to ſit on our breeches when we ſing or ſpeak praiſe unto him? Certainly the power of Errour is very great, that it can blind the mind of Man in a matter ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and plain. But I truſt that thoſe to whom I write are not ſo deceived.</p>
               <p>Yet I would not be thought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend any ſuch Uneaſineſs, as is either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the due compoſure of the Mind, or
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:185082:62"/>the good eſtate of the Body: I know God will have Mercy and not Sacrifice, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the due operations of the Mind before the moſt devout actions of the Body, (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where they cannot be both in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but our exactneſs in one muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate ſome relaxation in the other.) But there is an uneaſineſs that is ſo ſmall, that it rather helps than hinders inward De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and diſturbs nothing but a lazie humour, or ill habit; things no way to be indulged. But yet where there is ſuch real Infirmity as juſtly excuſeth from Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Kneeling upright, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Men ſhould be careful that in what poſture ſoever they be, they make ſuch expreſſions of Seriouſneſs and Devotion, that it may appear to the Congregation that they omit nothing out of Lazineſs, Contempt of the Orders of the Church, or a prophane Spirit.</p>
               <p>I have now run over the Daily Office of <hi>Morning Prayer;</hi> and ſhall proceed no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe he that will obſerve what I have written in that, cannot be to ſeek in ordering himſelf a right in all the reſt.</p>
               <p>It may not be inconvenient in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, to offer ſomething that may help us to ſhew our Devotion in leaving the Church, as well as in coming to it and continuing there. It is ſaid of the ancient
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:185082:62"/>
                  <hi>Jews,</hi> that they went out of the Synagogues backward, that they might declare their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs to leave God's Houſe, in which holy Men have deſired ever to dwell. And (whatever that way of expreſſing this may ſeem to ſome) I am ſure there ought to be ſuch affections in us, as was thereby ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified; and nothing we do that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereunto, can ſeem decent to wiſe Men; and if People's hurrying out of the Church as ſoon as ever the Sermon or Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are ended, be not apparently contrary to ſuch affection, my conceit deceives me; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, when they will not ſtay to take God's bleſſing along with them; I ſay God's, for though a Man pronounceth it, yet it is ſuch a Man, as is his Miniſter and Herald, the Steward of his Myſteries, whoſe words, as ſuch, he will never ſuffer to fall to the ground, but will give them their effect on all that are meet Subjects: and therefore to deſpiſe that glorious and myſterious Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing wherewith theſe holy Offices are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, ſhews great Ignorance to Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and little manners, and is an affront to the Bleſſed Trinity, and to the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation met to do Worſhip thereunto.</p>

               <p>ONe thing I have thought fit to add, as uſeful to the deſign of this Paper, which is, My humble Requeſt to Miniſters and Veſtries, that they will take care that fit and worthy Perſons be put into the Office of Pariſh-Clerks; for that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the People in performing their part of this Service, is chiefly imputable to this cauſe, that they have not a Clerk that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> able to lead them in the right way of that performance: for if the People would but conſider, that 'tis the ſpecial work of a Clerk to Guidethem in what they are to ſay and do in this Service, and would make ſuch obſervation of him as they ought, (he ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo advantageouſly for the ſame) it would bring the whole Congregation unto a good performance. Some Perſons that may offer themſelves, and that it may be the Pariſhes intereſt to chuſe, may have ſuch natural De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, that they can never be made fit for the place; and ſome are of ſuch a profane Spirit, that they will never ſet themſelves to ſtudy to do their duty therein. Both theſe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:185082:63"/>are to be rejected; whatever advantages the Pariſh may make by their Election: for, ſo ſacred a thing, as the Worſhip and Service of Almighty God, is not to be ſubjugated to the ſecular intereſts of Men: And it is a great reproach to any Pariſh, that, to ſave themſelves a little charge in maintaining a poor Family, they ſhould employ a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be Guide to the People in this moſt ſolemn Office of Divine Worſhip, that is in any way a ſcandal or diſhonour thereunto, or unfit to perform it as he ought. And if any ſuch be already in the place, my requeſt is, that the Miniſter and Veſtry will uſe their Authority to reform them, and engage them to ſtudy the moſt decent and graceful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of performance; and if that cannot be effected, to force them to admit the help of another, in that matter, though they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to do the Pariſh-buſineſs in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. I make this humble Requeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I believe that a Clerk that was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Man, and one that had a good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Voice, if he would ſet himſelf to ſtudy, to excel in performing what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him, he would greatly aſſiſt the People in the well performance of their part, and excite them thereunto.</p>

               <p>AND now I moſt humbly beſeech the Reverend Clergy of this Church that they will not deſpiſe the Advice of ſo unworthy a Perſon: If there be not <hi>Truth</hi> in what I write, I deſire not to be regarded, but if there be, <hi>Truth</hi> is a thing ſo Divine and Excellent, as not, for my unworthineſs or for any defects in the delivery, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; eſpecially, when it is Truth of the higheſt concern that can be imagined, that which concerns (and that moſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately) the glory and honour of the moſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:185082:64"/>High God, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt our moſt holy Saviour; that which concerns the ſupream good of the beſt of earthly Creatures, and that with relation to his better part, and his eternal ſtate; that which much concerns the happineſs and well-fare of this flouriſhing Church, and tends to its Unity, Sanctity, and Glory: That which concerns the diſcharge of your great Duty to God and his Church, and is the beſt Return of the Benefits you partake from both; I ſay, when it is <hi>Truth</hi> of ſuch concern, methinks it ſhould be conſider'd, and that whoever it come from as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, ſince God himſelf muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the Author.</p>
               <p>The Worſhip and Service of God hath been eſteemed of all wiſe Men, the chief of thoſe things wherein Men or Angels could imploy themſelves; 'Tis the principal End of bringing Men into Holy Orders, and of inſtituting Chriſtian Aſſemblies, the greateſt Means of inducing that ſuper-excellent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the Divine Life, that Evangelical Spirit which only can overcome our Vices, and ſublime Moral Vertues into Chriſtian Graces, and make our good Works Seeds of eternal Glory. This is the Prelibation of and Preparation for the unſpeakable Joys above: 'Tis this for which all our Noble
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:185082:65"/>Faculties were given us: 'Tis this that chiefly diſtinguiſheth us from Beaſts, and that, more then the meer ſhape of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, or our Natural Reaſon, and gives us the greateſt Likeneſs unto, and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Angels. 'Tis the Worſhip of One God that is the greateſt Incentive to Love, and the ſtrongeſt Bond of Peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men; and among Chriſtians, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more ſo, when we worſhip Him in and through One Mediator and Saviour, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Natural Worſhip which was offer'd in the State of Innocency, the Superſtitious Worſhip of guilty and affrighted Criminals, the Typical and Pedaegogical Worſhip of Moſaical Inſtitution, all theſe had ſomething of Excellency in them; nay, they were the beſt thing the World had beſides: But the Excellency and Glory of Evangelical Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is above them all, it far exceeds what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe we can do in this Life, and is the higheſt Felicity of the Life to come; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels began it here on Earth, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.13, 14 and ſhall rejoyce to accompany us therein when we are in Heaven. A Man that hath the Power of Godlineſs in his Soul, is apt to ſay when he is at Church, as the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples when they were on the Holy Mount. <hi>Lord it is good for us to be here;</hi> or as <hi>David
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:185082:65"/>Bleſſed are they that dwell in thy houſe, and are ever praiſing thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Things I have touched, that I might introduce this great Conſideration, <hi>That the moſt learned and highly dignified of the Clergy ought not to think it any abaſement of themſelves, but their great honour to read Common-Prayer:</hi> 'Tis not (as ſome would perſwade us) the eaſineſs of the Thing that can make it contemptible: There was no great difficulty in that which God requir'd of the Prieſts in the Services of the Temple, yet was their Office eſteemed no ſmall Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; the reaſon whereof was, becauſe they approached nigh to God in the Offices of his Solemn Worſhip: for as the Greatneſs of God's Majeſty requires, that not every one that can do the Thing, be admitted to perform it, as an act of his Solemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but that it be done by Perſons ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ſet apart thereunto; ſo the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration which Men receive unto this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice gives them the chiefeſt Dignity and Honour that is to be found among Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and all Nations ever had their Prieſts in higheſt Eſteem (however they are ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this prophane Age.) But then if their approach to God in the Offices of his Worſhip, which puts this great Honour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, becomes contemptible in their
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:185082:66"/>eyes, and they think ſcorn of all but Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I think they do greatly err.</p>
               <p>And when (through bodily Infirmity or the Attendance on other parts of their Miniſtry) they are obliged to imploy Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, I think, for the ſame reaſon, that they ought to take care that they get ſuch as (at leaſt) do not ſcandalize that Service either by their wicked Lives or undecent Performance. To perform the Publick Service of God in the Aſſemblies of his Servants, is too great an honour to be put on Fools or vile Perſons: Certainly ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very conſiderable muſt be pleaded in excuſe of thoſe, who profeſſing a great Zeal for Holineſs in their preaching, are careleſs whether the Prayers be read well or ill; and that do imploy ſuch to read them that are a diſhonour to this Service. It cannot be ſufficient to ſay that theſe Readers are poor Men, and that they have no other way to live, and that they imploy them out of meer Charity: For that Charity to Men which is againſt the Love of God, and a Regard to the Solemnity of his Worſhip, is an ill ſort of Charity: And ſo is that Charity to particular Perſons which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Edification of the Church: Nay, I am of Opinion it is no Charity to thoſe to whom it is ſhewed; for their ill Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:185082:66"/>proceeding (for the moſt part) from their vicious lives, which hath deſtroyed in them that ſenſe of God and Religion, which is the only due preparation to a well performance of this Service (as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before) ſo long as they ſee that ſlubbering over the Service without that Seriouſneſs and Devotion which their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Affections cannot admit, and which for the reaſon fore-mentioned, they find it difficult to counterfeit; I ſay, whilſt this will ſerve to get their living, they will not be ſo eaſily brought to Repentance, as if (being rejected of all on this account and brought to extream poverty) they were taught by the Rod to reflect on their folly, and to ſee the neceſſity of Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Affliction is God's way of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to Repent, and I think men ſhould not think to find any better. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wiſh that if Scholars will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, they may know they muſt be poor; and none that have power would put them into imployment in the Church, or own them; but as they have nothing to do to take God's Name into their mouths, while they hate to be Reformed, and caſt God's Word behind their backs, ſo the Church will not ſuffer them to do it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it is apparent they deſire it
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:185082:67"/>for a Secular Advantage, and to maintain them in a Vicious Life, and not out of any deſire to Serve God and his Church. And I earneſtly pray that a ſtop may be put to the admiſſion of ſuch into the Miniſtry if it might be, although I know 'tis extream difficult as things ſtand. For, as our Church directs, ſo we have great need to pray at this time, <hi>That God will ſo guide and govern the minds of the Biſhops and Paſtors of this Church, that they may lay hands ſuddenly on no man,</hi> &amp;c. which Prayer, I hope, will offend none.</p>
               <p>Some there are alſo that do it thus ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of Erroneous Principles, and ſome out of Carnal Wiſdom, the firſt ſort think the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> a grievous Impoſition, and that they ought to be left to their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to Pray as they pleaſe; but becauſe the Rulers will have it ſo, they ſubmit to it only to get their livings, or elſe for the ſake of <hi>Preaching;</hi> which being of ſo great neceſſity to men's Salvation, they think it muſt not be forſaken, though they are forc'd to accompany it with a defective diſorderly Form, (as they think ours is) and they hope their good intentions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men's Salvation will excuſe their uſing it, when they can do no better. But men thus minded will make what haſt they
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:185082:67"/>can to rid themſelves of what is burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and ſo ramble over the Service with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that Devotion it requires, and plainly ſhew by their careleſs manner of Reading that they do not love the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> though they are forc'd to uſe it.</p>
               <p>My Opinion is, that men of this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (as well as of the former) ought not to be incouraged neither by the Church nor the Miniſters thereof; and that they do need both Repentance and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſet them right in the Judgment of God and all good Men; God will be Sanctified in all that come nigh him, and that eſpecially by the moſt ſolemn, decent, and reverend Performance of the Offices of his Publick Worſhip; and this he can never be, by men that are not fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in their own minds of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fitneſs of the mode in which that Worſhip is performed. For 'tis certain that doubts in this, will hinder ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeaking, and ſuch deportment as becomes their approach to God, who is Glorious in Holineſs, and Dreadful in Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and in that reſpect alſo, I think it may well be required, by the Laws of this Church, that every one that is admitted to the Miniſtry do declare publickly <hi>their Aſſent and Conſent to all and every thing,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:185082:68"/>God himſelf doth require a full perſwaſion of mind concerning the goodneſs of what we do (eſpecially in weighty matters;) and tells us that whatſoever is not of Faith is Sin, and he that doubts is damned if he does that he doubts of; and therefore the Church cannot be blamed in this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: for ſuch Readers were better out of the Church than in it, for they ſcandalize the Excellent Service thereof, by their ſlight performance far more than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane do; for that they ſeeming very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout in their Pulpit-Prayers, and ſo inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devout in the Common Prayer, people are apt to think the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> not to be the Worſhip of God, but ſomething to be read on condition to have liberty to Preach, and that it is no matter how it be done if done; and 'tis theſe men that incourage offenſive and indecent behaviour, for many of their hearers though they are preſent at Prayers, yet never obſerve any thing that the Rubrick directs to be performed, but ſit and loll and ſtare about, and endeavour, as much as they can, to ſeem unconcern'd in what is done, till the Miniſter goes into his Pulpit (for they came to Church only for the ſake of what is done there) leſt they be thought to approve the Common Prayers: theſe, I ſear, conceit that they do
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:185082:68"/>well in this, from obſerving the ſlightneſs of ſuch Miniſters in Reading the Prayers; or at leaſt it prevents that conviction which ſuch might receive from the devout and reverend performing the ſame by others; and I believe this, becauſe in thoſe Churches, where the Miniſter is very devout in Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Service, I could never obſerve any ſuch behaviour; ſo that either ſuch people ſeldom come to ſuch Churches (and I think (giving more ſcandal by their ill Example than they receive benefit by the Service) they were better be abſent) or elſe the power of a <hi>Devout Performance</hi> is ſuch, that they cannot but be <hi>inclin'd to imitate it.</hi> Therefore if there be any ſuch imployed in the Miniſtry of this Church (as I have cauſe to fear there are) that Read ill on this account, I earneſtly intreat that they will reflect on the indecency and ill conſequences of ſuch practices, and (as a Remedy hereof) that they will conſult the moſt learned and judicious (that are devout) of our Church, for ſuller Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the Reaſonableneſs and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of our Service, that ſo they may perform it more Reverently and Affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, to the Honour of God and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Edification; and this they will find to be more comfortable to themſelves, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:185082:69"/>of better acceptance with all good men, than halting between Two Opinions: For it is evident, that if there were any thing ſinful in the performance, they ought not to have undertaken it at all (for Evil muſt not be done that Good may come.) But if there be only a defect of ſome degrees of Goodneſs in this Service; then, Reaſon requires, that they do not make it worſe, by an ill performance; but that they do make the beſt of it for effecting the ends to which it is deſigned, <hi>viz.</hi> God's Honour, and our Spiritual Conſolation. Yet thoſe that Read ill on the account of <hi>ſuch Error,</hi> are more to be pitied and leſs condemned than thoſe that do ſo out of a kind of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Wiſdom;</hi> yet ſuch there are; I mean thoſe who are very unwilling to ſeem Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and Devout in that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by a great Party of Men, becauſe they may (ſome time or other) be upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and indeed when ſuch men can ſtand as fair for Preferment for the preſent as the moſt devout, and yet have the good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thoſe in whoſe power it may be to prefer them hereafter; there may be many temptations of this kind eſpecially among a People conſiſting of Parties, that bear an equal Balance, and therefore the Conſideration of this is not to be deſpiſed.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:185082:69"/>Men are apt to think they may ſerve God and Mammon, but it cannot be; 'tis true we may and muſt become all things to all men that we may win ſome, but in this they rather win us than we them; (if it may be called a winning, when for fear that a Party may prevail, we are indevout in what we own for the Worſhip of God) and indeed we ſhall never win them from their Errors by ſuch compliance: for the reaſon of all mankind muſt agree, that men may not ſerve their own Carnal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts to the prejudice of <hi>that Worſhip whereby God is moſt eminently Served and Honoured in the World:</hi> And whilſt theſe men acknowledge our Liturgy to be <hi>ſuch,</hi> none can approve their indevout perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance for fear of being eſteemed <hi>High Church Men,</hi> and of loſing their Intereſt in that they call <hi>the Moderate Party;</hi> nor will any of that Party ever be brought from the admiration of the <hi>Ex tempore</hi> Way by ſuch kind of politique Readers: And yet I believe theſe men do miſtake their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> (I mean even in things Temporal) for the Pious of every Party agree in this, that men ſhould have an hearty Zeal in the Way of Worſhip they uſe, and do ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor ſuch men as prefer their own Intereſt before God's Honour. Now if Times ſhould
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:185082:70"/>change, a man, formerly Zealous in the Way of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if he ſhould ſee Cauſe to change with them (as he may ſometimes do) would have as kind Reception among ſuch, as thoſe that were afraid to be zealous for fear of offending them, and they would be more apt to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in bringing one ſuch devout man to their way than in the Conformity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch luke-warm worſhippers. And for thoſe that in all ways of Religion make Gain their Godlineſs. and only follow Chriſt for the Loaves and Fiſhes, they are for ſhutting out as many as they can (on any pretence) from ſharing in the Benefits of their Church-Order, and think <hi>the fewer the better chear,</hi> they will be ſure to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from preferment, thoſe that fared well in the times that were ill with them (whether they were zealous in the contrary way or not) by ſuch terms of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as they ſhall very hardly comply with: or if they have a Latitude beyond men's reach in that kind, 'tis ten to one but the want of the fear of God will betray them to ſome vices that will ſpoil the comfort of all their worldly enjoyments, and make them leſs happy than the greateſt ſufferers for Nonconformity can be: But laſtly, if Carnal Wiſdom ſhould ſo diſcern the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:185082:70"/>of ſuch Vices with this Worldly Happineſs, as, on that account they ſhould avoid them, yet the loſs of the Endleſs Joys of Heaven, which ſuch ſhall never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, will detect the folly of this ſinful Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and carnal Compliances.</p>
               <p>I fear theſe kind of Men will but deride me for all this, and be more hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to be truly zealous and devout Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders than either the <hi>Profane</hi> or <hi>Erroneous,</hi> becauſe they have leſs ſenſe of the things of another Life, and what relates thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, then either of them. Concerning the later there is no queſtion, and of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer not much; for <hi>the cares of the World and deceitfulneſs of Riches,</hi> are named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the Pleaſures of other things, in choaking the Heavenly Seed, (viz.)</hi> The Doctrine of Eternal Life. For though <hi>Senſual Pleaſures</hi> are of another Nature, and have other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects than Spiritual, and are therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Pleaſures of other things,</hi> and upon that account muſt needs diſcompoſe the Mind and make it unfit to conceive or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Delights and Pleaſure of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God and his Saints in theſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Exerciſes, yet becauſe we are many times uncapable of ſuch Senſual Pleaſures, and ſatiety oft turns to loathing, (eſpecially for a time) this helps men to ſee the vanity
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:185082:71"/>thereof, ſo that they may be diſpoſed by good counſel at ſuch a time to turn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſeek the Pleaſures that are always Savory and Laſting, of which we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſurfeit. But now theſe Luſts of the World (that is Covetouſneſs of Worldly Riches) as they are more inſatiable than thoſe of the Fleſh, ſo they have ſcarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny receſſes: they follow us into our Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets, and to Church; accompany us when Sickneſs ſhuts us into our Chambers, and even on our very Death beds; and nothing but the utter deſtruction of our Faculties can eradicate this Love of Money: Theſe Luſts give us no time or compoſure for the Hearty and Zealous Service of God, but tho' our Bodies be preſent, our Minds being agitated with Thoughts about the World, cannot intend what is done to the Honour of God and their Souls Health as they ought. Therefore Men of this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per can't be good Readers till they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; and their Converſion is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult as our Saviour hath taught, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.24. There remains therefore, but this Way to make them Read well, That it be for their Worldly Advantage ſo to do, and that none will employ them except they can approve themſelves to Read very well: and this will make them Study it, and it
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:185082:71"/>may be, Do it as well to the Peoples Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication (though not to their own Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God) as the moſt Pious Men. And it is my humble Requeſt, to thoſe who Imploy Readers, That they will be ſure they do ſo before they Admit them to the Place, and will not ſuffer themſelves, by any Importunity, Intereſt, Relation, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thing, to be drawn to Accept an ill Reader, to the diſhonour of this Service whereby we Glorifie God, and in which we enjoy the Higheſt and moſt Heavenly Delights in our own Minds and Spirits, if a good one may be got. But becauſe there may be defect of ſuch, and that they may be forced to accept ſuch as need the Inſtruction, Incouragement, and good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the Miniſters to whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, my Requeſt is farther, That neither their reſerving themſelves for long and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Preaching (which I fear, God will not bleſs, when ſet up to the contempt of the Prayers) nor Greatneſs, nor Studies, nor Buſineſs, nor any thing elſe may hinder them from Reading ſometimes themſelves, according to that good Order of our Church which they are many ways obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to obſerve; and the more obliged, for that they receive a large ſhare of the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and Benefits thereof; I beſeech them
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:185082:72"/>therefore that once a Month at the leaſt, they will moſt Devoutly and Solemnly Read the Service of the Church in their own Perſons, that thereby the Readers may ſee they have a great love for the ſame, and be excited to do their Part the better in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their Maſters. For certainly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will be ſo prevalent as the Example of thoſe on whom they depend to make Readers more ſtudious and induſtrious to do their Duty. And to this I alſo beſeech them to add one thing more, as that which will be of great avail to beget a reverence and good eſteem for our Prayers in the Minds of the People, and draw them to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend more Conſtantly and Devoutly upon them; and that is, That the Miniſters of the Pariſhes will never omit (but when conſtrained thereunto) to be themſelves preſent at the Prayers, when ever they are read in their own Churches: And alſo that here, in this City, where Churches are very near (in ſome of which Prayers are read twice a day) that all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Miniſters will come as often as they can poſſible, to ſuch Prayers. It hath been a great Grief and Offence to ſome good Men, as I have heard them complain, that they ſee ſo few Miniſters at the daily Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at St. <hi>Chriſtophers;</hi> a Church that ſtands
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:185082:72"/>moſt advantageouſly, to give Example and Influence to the City and Kingdom; where Prayers are read twice every day: and the Example of a devout Attendance and good Performance of Eminent Miniſters of our Church in that Place, would for ought I know, Influence the whole Nation unto a greater Reverence for the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip according to this Order. Others I have heard complain of the Miniſters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring into the Veſtry all the time of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, as if they came to Church to Study and not to Worſhip, and were not as much concerned in the Common Prayers of the Church as the People. I know not what their Plea may be in this Caſe, but I have not been able by my own wit to excuſe them to thoſe that have blamed them for it: But the worſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of all hath been, That of many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who at the time of ſome eminent Lectures, will ſit in a Coffee-Houſe, till Prayers be almoſt done, and rather let their Company be wanting to the Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God's Holy Worſhip, than leave a Pipe of Tobacco before it be ſmoak'd out, or not take their uſual Doſe of Tea or Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee: I confeſs I have been much troubled to hear of it, and am more ſo to mention it, eſpecially thus publickly, if the thing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:185082:73"/>were not notorious, and in no way that I know of, I can aſſiſt the Reformation of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſo well as in this, which I hope will plead my excuſe with all good Men.</p>
               <p>I know Miniſters may be many ways hindred ſometimes, from attendance at dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prayers, and I am againſt thoſe that are ſo cenſorious in imputing their omiſſion to ill cauſes; no man deſires to preſerve a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Reverence and Reſpect for the Clergy of our Church than my ſelf, but yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not excuſe them wholly in this matter, and therefore I humbly beg, that it may not be reckoned any ſign of diſ-reſpect that in my Zeal for the Service of God I have proceeded thus far, ſince I believe the good or ill State of this Church depends much on the Eſteem or Contempt that is had of its Publick Service of God, and the Good Order appointed for the ſame, and upon the Love and Reverence, or Neglect and Contempt of it by its Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which will very much influence the Minds of the People in this matter.</p>
               <p>I have but one thing more to beg of them, which I muſt crave leave to preſs with ſome earneſtneſs: which is this,</p>
               <p>That in their Sermons they frequently inculcate the Duty of being conſtant and devout in attending the Common Prayer,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:185082:73"/>and that they prove to their People, That it is not only poſſible, but much more eaſie, to be devout in the uſe of Forms of Prayer, than in the <hi>Ex tempore</hi> Way: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks when Papiſts out of a Malicious Deſign to divide us that they may deſtroy us, and Separatiſts out of Miſtakes of ſome Scripture Expreſſions and — an Opinion of Experience, cry up the way of <hi>Ex tempore</hi> Prayer in oppoſition to the Publick Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, to the diſtracting Mens minds, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the Church; I ſay, ſurely, ſince it is ſo, the Miniſters of our Church ſhould not think themſelves unconcerned about the Eſteem their People have of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer and their Devotion in the uſe of it. But ſince they that are againſt us on both ſides, are ſo earneſt in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own ways and reproaching us, the Miniſters ſhould not be remiſs in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-working ſuch ill Deſigns by the moſt Rational and Convincing Demonſtration, joined with Fervency and Importunity of Perſwaſion in their Preaching on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>And here I muſt firſt obſerve, That ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Exhortations to Piety and Holineſs, how Excellently and Paſſionately ſoever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by our Miniſters, tho they may make them admired and followed, and that by
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:185082:74"/>Men of ſeveral Perſwaſions, yet they will not have the effect ſuch ſhould intend, if Mens minds be corrupted with falſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, about the exerciſing and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Piety and Holineſs: But as the beſt Food may do Men hurt by reaſon of ill Humors in the Stomach; ſo may ſuch good Doctrine through ill Principles in the Underſtanding. Such as think the beſt way to be holy is to Conſecrate themſelves in the Blood of Heretiques, as the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or of ſuch as will not let Chriſt rule over them, as ſome Enthuſiaſts; (believing that as the <hi>Levites</hi> were by <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded to Conſecrate themſelves, every Man on his Son and on his Brother that had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Idolatry in worſhipping the Calf, ſo they may Conſecrate themſelves by this) and ſuch as think the way of Holineſs lies in diſtinction of Words and Phraſe, and in their Garb and Garments, or in ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſome Indifferent and Apocriphal Obſervances not injoined by God nor the Church: Nay, if they think it lies in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above Ordinances and rejecting both the Sacraments, in railing againſt God's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and cenſuring all their Neighbours that are not of their Sect, and calling us all Ignoramus's and Perſecutors; or, (which is moſt my Subject) in condemning all Forms
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:185082:74"/>of Prayer, and all Superiority among Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters as Popiſh and Anti-chriſtian, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding Independency as the only Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptural Church-Government, and the <hi>Ex tempore</hi> Way as the onely Acceptable Mode of Worſhip (and that in publick as well as private) I ſay, all theſe and whatever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of like kinds (of which there are abundance in the World) when they hear the moſt Powerful and Paſſionate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to Piety in general terms, they make the Application <hi>to Zeal in their own Way:</hi> Wherefore I think thoſe Miniſters who believe that in a Sincere and Diligent Improvement of the Order of our Church we may Exerciſe the moſt Fervent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion towards God, and the moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Communion of Saints in Holy Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and alſo proſecute the Sanctification of our Hearts and Lives, in a way to be preferr'd before all other Ways wherein Men pride themſelves: I ſay, thoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that believe this (as all of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and eſpecially thoſe concern'd in its Government, I hope, verily do) ſhould not think it enough to preach up Piety in general, but ſhould think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to make ſuch particular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to a Devout and Conſtant At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> as a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:185082:75"/>Act of it, as may prevent ſuch abuſe of their Sermons by Men of ill Principles, and make them moſt ſerviceable to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God and Peace and Welfare of this Church.</p>
               <p>If we Obſerve the Sermons and Books of the Nonconformiſts on this Subject, it will appear that all their Diſcourſes of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have always a ſecret (and very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an open) Relation to the Exerciſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in their own way, and very bad Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on ours as being but a kind of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantry and oſtentation of Devotion, and meer formality and outſide, without that life and power which makes it acceptable to God, and that ſuch Devotion is no evidence that we are truly Regenerate and his Elect People. And this is that which confirms their Diſciples in their own way, and hinders them from ſo much as trying ours. And ſhall the Miniſters of our Church be out-done by thoſe they account Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks? Doth not the Ancient Orderly and Solemn Way of our Church deſerve as much Zeal as the novel Ways cried up with them? Is not the Honour of God and Salvation of Mens Souls as much concerned in being devout in our way as in theirs? Is not a great love to the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> a delight to attend conſtantly on the Offices
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:185082:75"/>thereof and a fervent Devotion therein, as good a ſign of true Grace as the love of <hi>Extempore Prayer,</hi> and a delight in going frequently to private Meetings? Is not the neglect of God's Worſhip in our way (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by thoſe that profeſs to approve the Order we have for it) a ſign of the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtate of carnal-mindedneſs and unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſs (from which Men muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, except they will be damned) and ſo to be eſteemed by us, as well as the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect thereof in their way. All Men know, that no Way or Mode of Religion is ſo good that Men ſhould be thought good Chriſtians meerly for being Educated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and Profeſſing to approve the ſame: but ſuch Education and Profeſſion will ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate their ſin if they be not ſerious in that Way of Religion they approve, and ſo will the Excellency and Goodneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if they ſlight it. And ſhould not the Miniſters of God (who muſt bear the blame for ever if God be diſhonoured, or Souls damned through their default) Conſider this, and perſwade Men to a greater love to God and to his Worſhip in the Way of this Church? And ſo to order their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns with Relation thereunto, that they may approve themſelves truly Converted and ſuch as ſhall be Saved. 'Tis Seriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:185082:76"/>in Religion that ſpeaks Men true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and this joined with Conſtant At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendancy on Religious Duties (which is the fruit thereof) is their ſecurity againſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy of all kinds, and I muſt ſay this, that however there may be, and I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent there are, ſome of all the different Ways of Religious Worſhip that are truly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and ſhall be Saved; yet none that I have known are better Chriſtians then they who are Serious and truly Devout in the Way of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> I know there are many Hypocrites that ſeem ſo and are not, amongſt us as well as others, but I ſpeak of the Sincere. And if it be ſo, ſure Miniſters ſhould think it their Glory and Joy when they can bring Men from a Carnal and Unregenerate State, to that which is truly Spiritual and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. It hath been ſome grief to me to ſee that Miniſters on both extreams ſhould out-do ours in this matter; thoſe of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſeem to exult, not only when they can bring one of our Religion over to their Church, but when any of their own turn from a Worldly Secular Life, to that which they call Religious and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual: And the Separatiſts not onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to leave us upon the account of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the World and devoting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:185082:76"/>to God, but to ſet up their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on purpoſe to call others to a more Spiritual Life in communion with them, and rejoice greatly in their ſucceſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and in nothing do they more glory over us than in out-doing us in Seriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Intention in the Matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, And ſhould we give them cauſe ſo to do?</p>
               <p>It ſeems to me, in very deed, there is too great cauſe of the ſame Complaint in Chriſtian States (where Men are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by their Birth-right) as was in that of the Jews under the Law, <hi>That there is none that underſtandeth and ſeeketh after God,</hi> and much more then was in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles times (where Men choſe Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity though accompanied with Reproaches and Perſecutions) when yet it is ſaid, That all minded their own things, and not the things of Jeſus Chriſt: The Worſhip and Honour of God and our Saviour, is not ſo dear to Men as their Secular Advantages. Men do not believe or conſider that it is of neceſſity to their Salvation to love God above all, to do all that ever they do with a greater relation to his Honour than to their own Carnal Advantages; and that the careleſs neglect of theſe Holy Offices, when they might order it ſo as
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:185082:77"/>to have time to attend them, gives great ſuſpicion they live to themſelves and not to God, and are yet but Carnally Minded and in a ſtate of Spiritual Death. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks therefore, thoſe who have Care of Mens Souls ſhould be Jealous over them, leſt that all their Labour ſhould be in vain, whil'ſt they continue ſuch under their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; and be in Travel, as Women with Child, for their Regeneration. 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a woful ſign when Miniſters have no greater Concern than to get Money and to make the beſt of his Livings, and little regard whether his People be pious or profane: God complains heavily of this in many places of Scripture; and it were eaſie here to declaim againſt it in many words, if it were not ſufficiently done by others, and alſo ſo evident in it ſelf, that no Miniſter that will but think on't, can be ignorant of the great ſinfulneſs of ſuch a Temper; and that the Wrath of GOD, and Curſes of the Damned for this their neglect, awaits them in the World to come, and that they are the grief of good Men, and the ſcorn of bad ones in this World on that very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. They cannot but know that it is they that make Men Separatiſts, while no Man that hath any Concern for his
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:185082:77"/>Soul, can indure to live under a Miniſter that regards the Souls of his People not half ſo much as he doth the Life of his Beaſts: And I wonder they can blame any Man for endeavouring their ſuſpenſion, ſince they can be no true Chriſtians, who had rather ſee ſo many Souls damned, as may be in danger of it by ſuch Mens neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, then that they ſhould be diſplaced by a Juſt Suſpenſion, that a better may take their Place. For my part, I wiſh all Pariſhioners were convinced of their Duty in this kind, and would endeavour all that is poſſible, in juſt ways, to remove ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters: And thoſe that are moſt offended at this, ſhould do their duty in this before they think of ſeparating from the Church; and thoſe that have not thought of this, (which was the right way to eaſe their grief) but run into the wrong way of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, let them now return at the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Invitation of this Church by her beſt Miniſters: and when they have reſolved to do their Duty to God, and to the Church, according as the Law requires, let them, in God's Name, ſee that their Miniſters do theirs too, eſpecially in taking care of the Souls of their People, and in performing what the Law of God and the Church requires of them in order thereunto; and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:185082:78"/>and if, by humble Intreaties, and a pious Example, and by due Attendance for their Reformation, they cannot prevail with them, they ought to complain to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of the Dioceſs, to endeavour their Suſpenſion, and that more Faithful ones may be Intruſted by them, with the Cure of their Souls: And it ſeems a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to perſwade all Nonconformiſts that are truly Pious to return to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of our Church, and to indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to approve themſelves Devout and Pious in the Offices of God's Worſhip ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred therein, for that by ſo doing they may be greatly helpful to the Reformation of things amiſs, to the Incouraging the good and Removing unworthy Miniſters, to the Honour of our Religion, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Mens Souls: And I believe there be many Pious Biſhops in this Church that would be glad to have ſuch juſt proof of the Miſdemeanors and Neglects of their Clergy, as might inable them to ſuſpend ſuch as deſerve it, and put into Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thoſe that are able and willing to do better, and there are many ſuch to my knowledge, who can have no Imployment in the Church, while theſe naughty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by the favour of careleſs and proſane Patrons, get into good Livings: And I
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:185082:78"/>look on it as none of the leaſt miſchiefs of Separation, that thereby thoſe that ſhould be Inſtruments of Reforming the Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Churches by Example, Admonition, and aſſiſting the Exerciſe of Diſcipline there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, (which cannot take place there through the prevalency of Prophaneſs, and majority of evil Men) forſake them and leave Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and People to periſh together, at leaſt for any thing they will do to help to ſave them. 'Tis not enough for ſuch to rail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ill Miniſters and corrupt Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for if it be found that through their unjuſt forſaking the Church to join in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Societies, it comes to paſs that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes cannot be reformed, nor evil Men (Clergy or Laity) be expell'd as they ought, their profeſſed deteſtation of ſuch will not excuſe them, but aggravates their guilt: But this Subject hath been ſufficiently Handled by others, I onely thought fit to mention it, that none may think a legal liberty to ſeparate will excuſe them from Sin or Schiſm.</p>
               <p>But as I have thus expreſſed my Diſlike of thoſe Miniſters that are negligent in a Charge of ſuch Infinite and Eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment; ſo I cannot but declare my great Reſpect for ſuch as are Diligent and Faithful: and many ſuch there are (God
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:185082:79"/>be thanked) in this City and Kingdom; however ſome Nonconformiſts have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported them ſo few, that they were next to none.</p>
               <p>And I do heartily congratulate the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſucceſs of ſuch Miniſters; ſuch, who in Conſcience of their <hi>Aſſent and Conſent to the Orders of this Church,</hi> have taken upon them the conſtant daily Reading of the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> in their Pariſh-Churches, and that do frequently Adminiſter the Lord's Supper therein; that do not make the backwardneſs of their People to come to Prayers and the Sacrament, a pretence for their own neglect (when they never tried how forward they would be if they had Opportunity and good Inſtruction) but ſet themſelves to do their own part <hi>(in waiting on the Miniſtries to which they are called)</hi> and to perſwade the People to do theirs, in a conſtant and devout Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance thereon, and to beg God's Bleſſing on their Endeavours, for their Peoples E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification and Salvation. In this way they have found ſucceſs beyond their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (the numbers of thoſe, that have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Prayers and Sacrament, being much greater than what ſlothful Miniſters ſuggeſted to be likely;) and the comfort and ſatisfaction of performing their Duty,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:185082:79"/>and their delight in the good ſucceſs of it, as far beyond that of the negligent in their carnal eaſe and pleaſure. And I have great hopes that if others would follow their good Example (eſpecially at this time) it would be a means to reſtore the Unity, Peace and Glory of this Famous Church, to prevent the Confuſions and Troubles we are afraid of, and to eſtabliſh us on ſuch ſure Foundations, that the Gates of Hell, (the Subtilty of the Jeſuits, and Bandings of all ſorts of Fanaticks) ſhall not be able to deſtroy us, or alter our well ſetled Conſtitution. And I beſeech thoſe Miniſters, that, by their Pious and Unbla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Lives and Excellent Preaching, have obtained a great Reputation among the People, and a potent Intereſt in their Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that they will now ſhew themſelves hearty Friends to this Church, and be very Devout and Serious in Performing the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God's Publick Worſhip, according to the Preſcription thereof, and Zealous in perſwading the People to attend the ſame, that now when the inforcement of the Laws brings many Diſſenters to Church, who formerly never came there, we may ſhew them the Practice of our Publick Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in its own Beauty and Excellency; and this would be more effectual to their
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:185082:80"/>Converſion to the Union and Communion of our Church than any Diſputes can be. And I alſo beſeech thoſe Miniſters that are moſt ſtrict Obſervers of the External Part of the Rubrick, and moſt Zealous Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Lawfulneſs and Excellency of all things in our Church Order, that they will alſo ſhew themſelves as Zealous Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſers of the Internal Part, <hi>viz.</hi> Of that Devotion that is agreeable thereunto; and lead a Life in other things that may adorn the Order of this Church, and allure Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters into the Communion thereof: And I believe this would do much more good than reproaching them with their former Miſcarriages, and putting a harſh interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on their preſent Compliances; than exulting in the Execution of the Laws, and uſing bitter Invectives in Sermons or Diſcourſes, againſt them. I would not be thought to diſcourage any in what is truly their Duty, as it may be of our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours to inforce the Laws of the Land: And I believe, they deſign onely the bringing the Nonconformiſts to a ſober and ſerious Conſideration of their Duty, and a faithful and impartial Enquiry after ſatisfaction in ſuch things as they ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; that we may all Unite in the Solemn Worſhip of that God who is pleaſed when
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:185082:80"/>his Houſe is filled, and bids that Men be conſtrained to come in; that we may Live in Chriſtian Charity and keep the Bond of Peace (now much looſened by our different Orders and diſtinct Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;) that we may Join together to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Popiſh Deſigns (which are much furthered by our Diviſions;) Finally, that we may provoke one another to Love, Honour, and Obey our Superiours, and to Incourage their Government by moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and free Aſſiſtance; and may lay aſide all unjuſt Suſpicions, and froward Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereby they may be provoked: that ſo at laſt there may be no other ſtrife, but whether the Prudence and Sweetneſs of their Government, or the Humility and Reverence of our Obedience, ſhall be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>And although the Penalties which the Laws inflict on Diſſenters ſeem ſevere, yet ſince the Execution thereof is committed to a moſt Merciful Prince, furniſhed with the Advice and Counſel of moſt Pious, Prudent and Moderate Biſhops, and by his Prerogative Royal he may make ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxations and Moderations therein as the Circumſtances of Perſons and Things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, I cannot think it my Duty (or any Man's elſe) to diſcourage any (eſpecially
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:185082:81"/>the Miniſters, as now obliged) in preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as do not Communicate in our Publick Worſhip and the Bleſſed Sacrament. And I cannot but obſerve this in our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Conſtitution, That as the Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Laws againſt thoſe that Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Diſſent from the Publick Order, and affront the Wiſdom of Law-makers, by ſetting up their Self choſen Ways a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that they preſcribe: I ſay, as this doth ſecure the Peace of the Kingdom as well as it can be; ſo their allowing to the King his Prerogative Royal and Supream Headſhip in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, provides better for what Toleration and Connivance is needful towards Peaceable Conſcientious Diſſenters, than any of the Models in which ſome Men have taken ſo great pains to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Parliament what Laws to make: But all this on the by.</p>
               <p>I know ſome will think me over Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and that it were better to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Miniſters in their Compliance with Nonconformiſts; Connivance at their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and breach of Order and their not coming to the Sacrament; and in their pleaſing them by omitting many things in our Service, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But although I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Piety in all, and would pleaſe my Neighbour for his good to Edification,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:185082:81"/>yet I do not think we are bound to remit any thing of our Duty to God and our Governours for that Reaſon; neither do I think that Edification lies in being hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored in that kind, I am ſure the Peace of the Church doth not: Hear what Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> writes on this Subject, and I doubt not it will be better taken from him than from me. <hi>Cure,</hi> pag. 392. <q>The Paſtors who will preſerve the Churches, muſt not be ſo tender of preſerving their Intereſt in <hi>the Religious Perſons of their Charge (ſuch as are their Pariſhioners)</hi> as to depart from Sober Principles and Ways, (<hi>ſuch as thoſe in the Church of</hi> England <hi>are in our Judgments</hi>) to pleaſe them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> And a little farther, <q>This pleaſing Men is not the Way of Peace, it may prove a Palliate Cure for the preſent, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth for after Troubles and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.— for the weakneſs which crieth up one Error to day may cry up more to morrow (and 'tis ſo in crying down too) and if you will pleaſe them, you muſt follow them on, except you repent; and then you might at much cheaper rates have forſook them juſt where they forſook the <hi>Way of Truth and Peace.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>(Such is the obſervance of the Order of our Church.)</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:185082:82"/>
               <p> For though Mens Humours, their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Affections, and Erroneous Conceits may be gratified hereby; yet their Reaſon and Conſcience is not: When Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſeriouſly, that the Miniſter doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Laws and Orders made with greateſt Advice of Church and State; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Publick and Solemn Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Aſſent thereunto, and Conſent to Practiſe accordingly; againſt his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Promiſe at his Ordination, and alſo by Subſcriptions; and againſt the Unity and Peace of the Church: I ſay, when they conſider this, they cannot in their Reaſon and Conſcience approve the Omiſſions, Alterations or Additions which ſome take liberty to make in the Matters of God's Worſhip preſcribed by the Rubrick. For the violation of ſuch Obligations in Sacred Things (though ſeemingly ſmall) carries in it the appearance of Contempt of God and his Church: God looks we ſhould be Juſt and Faithful to our Promiſes in ſmall things as well as great, and if it were lawful for them to Promiſe, it is neceſſary they ſhould be careful to Perform: It is not haſte of Buſineſs or every kind of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation that can excuſe the curtailing of the Service; nothing, but what a Man may juſtly think the Church would have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:185082:82"/>for an excuſe (if ſhe had fore-ſeen it) and diſpenſe with her Laws for, can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Conſcience from the Obligation of this Promiſe at any time.</p>
               <p>Therefore if any one, to pleaſe his own private fancy, or to gratifie others, leaves out, or puts in, or alters any thing of the Service, I cannot think but he ſins againſt God; and I am ſure he gives offence to many that have a Reverence for the Orders of the Church; and ſcandal to thoſe that have not; and incourages others to reject and diſobey them in greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But that which is worſt of all, is, that it divides the Miniſtry and the Church: Some are counted Moderate Men and Friends to <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> and <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> whil'ſt others (that believe ſuch to be Schiſmaticks, and that the Church hath given them no cauſe of diſpleaſure) who ſtrictly obſerve the Orders of the Church, and ſeek not ſo much to pleaſe as to bring Diſſenters to Repentance and a return to their Duty, theſe are branded as <hi>Popiſhly Affected Perſecutors</hi> and <hi>High Church Men,</hi> and are many ways rendred contemptible to the Vulgar. It ſeems to me a thing much to be deſired, that Miniſters would agree to be Uniform in their Practice in theſe Matters; and that they would all
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:185082:83"/>throughly ſtudy the Rubrick, and agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in what caſes they may be excuſed from the ſtrict obſervances of ſuch things, which many conſtantly omit, and others very often; and let the People know it; that we may not think it proceeds from condemning themſelves of doing amiſs in their promiſes to obſerve all and every thing, from differences of Judgment about the Lawfulneſs of ſuch Things, or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Publick Order; and in what ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes we may expect it, and in what not: And I think if the Miniſters of this City did begin this Agreement, it might give great Satisfaction and good Example to the Country. I have heard ſome Country Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters (that are for ſtrict Obedience) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Defects of ſome Eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in this City in this matter of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Directions of the Rubrick, and that they have found by Diſcourſe with them, that it hath been cauſed through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, in that they never throughly Read it. Certainly this is a great Reproach, and ſhould be conſidered; and ſince the chief ſtrength of this Church conſiſts in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which is given by its Miniſters (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe that ſhould be Examples to the reſt) to the Rules and Orders thereof, and their Unity and good Agreement in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:185082:83"/>the ſame, I hope this Advice will not be deſpiſed: And I am ſure this will make much for the Agreement of the People, who are much diſtracted and divided by the different Practices (as well as Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) of the Conforming Clergy, and they would be more diſpoſed to ſeek Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction about Conforming to the Orders of the Church, who ſcruple it, if their Scruples were not too much Juſtified by theſe Mens Irregularities; and they would be a thouſand times more like to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and brought into good Order by the Methods preſcribed by the Laws of Church and State, if they had not this to ſay for themſelves, That, thoſe who Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them for breaking the Laws, make but little Conſcience of keeping them themſelves, or of ſuffering others (that believe all things good and lawful that are ordered) to walk diſorderly; not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Law, but through breaking it, to diſhonour the Wiſdom of Church and State themſelves: whereas they diſobey, not out of contempt, but becauſe they fear to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour God and offend againſt the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of their own Conſciences, and would ſwear (as I have heard many ſay) that it is not to ſerve any Intereſt, but out of pure Conſcience they Conform not (although
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:185082:84"/>I fear, they have not uſed due ways of ſatisfaction.) Now it is mighty hard to give a Reaſon why ſome ſhould be indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a ſlothful or contemptuous Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and they puniſhed that diſobey out of Conſcience. I confeſs could we ſay, that theſe Men proſecute the End of the Law, which is the Edification of the Church, and the Peace and Proſperity of the State, Unity and Charity in each Man's Pariſh; in which Caſes ſome things at ſome times, may be diſpenſed with; (and a Man may be ſure the Law-makers meant they ſhould:) or could we ſay it were like to win the Scrupulous Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that theſe Men paſs over many things that the Church injoyns, and do ſome which ſhe allows not, we might ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to purpoſe to ſilence this Complaint, but it is hard to prove either, (when ſo many Worthy Perſons of this Church have written ſo much to the contrary, and Twenty Years Experience diſproves it;) therefore the beſt way to bring Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts to Reverence and Obey the Publick Order, to promote Peace, Amity and Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, is, For theſe that are called Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable Miniſters, to take care to obſerve the Publick Order ſtrictly themſelves, and to have frequent Conferences, Perſonal
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:185082:84"/>and by Letters, for the effecting a general Agreement therein: And I moſt humbly beſeech the moſt Reverend the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and Right Reverend Biſhops of this Church, to take the Matter into their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Thoughts, and conſider what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern they have herein, ſince the different uſages of Miniſters in Cathedrals (in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Biſhop himſelf) gives great offence to ſome that hold the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Obligation to a Uniformity in all things, and gives greateſt ſtrength to the Argument of the Diſſenters againſt their being proſecuted for not obſerving the Laws.</p>
               <p>There is one Thing which the Rubrick moſt plainly orders, but is generally omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The Adminiſtring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment every Sunday, at the leaſt in Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Churches, and I mention it, becauſe I believe the due performance thereof, and the preparations requiſite to the ſame, would be a great means to reform the Manners of thoſe that officiate in Choirs, of the Officers belonging thereunto, and of the Servants of the Biſhops and the Chief of the Clergy; theſe ought frequently to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ſame (as well as the Prieſts and Deacons) and may be eaſily brought to it by the Authority of their Maſters (and no
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:185082:85"/>doubt many Devout Perſons in the City would come alſo) and this Solemnity, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as it ought, I verily believe would be a means to reſtore much of Primitive Devotion, which the Errors and Diſputes of the late Times had almoſt utterly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; and I believe alſo that the Zeal and Devotion of the Biſhops and chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of this Church, in thus promoting Piety and Devotion, and indeavouring ſuch a Reformation in the Place of their Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and among the Officers that depend moſt on them, would mightily convince the Diſſenters of their Sincerity in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and ſilence their ſcandalous Reports of them, and induce a greater Reverence and Reſpect towards them among all the People. And I am apt to think the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Contempt that is caſt on the Clergy by the generality of the People, is permitted by Almighty God as a puniſhment for the ſo great neglect of this moſt Solemn Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Office in that Place which ſhould be an Example to all others, and would have a great Influence upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Conclude this Diſcourſe with my hearty Prayer to Almighty God, that he will indue his Miniſters with Righteouſneſs, and make his Choſen People Joyful.</hi>

               <p>I Shall now add to the People, as I did to the Miniſters, an earneſt Exhortation, <hi>That they will ſeriouſly conſider this Matter, and attend the performance of their Duty,</hi> that I may not loſe my Labour in directing their Behaviour.</p>
               <p>If Men will not diſpoſe themſelves to Serious Conſideration, we were as good talk to Men aſleep, or to the dead; neither God hath made any Promiſe, or Men can have any hope, that ſuch ſhall ever be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned with the knowledge of the Truth. The moſt Glorious Light of Spiritual and Eternal Life, <hi>our Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> even he gives Light to none but <hi>thoſe that will awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken themſelves and ariſe from the dead;</hi> and what can be hoped a Candle ſhould do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Sun? Men had formerly learnt to talk of Spiritual Drowſineſs and Death, as if it were bound upon us by ſuch a fatal neceſſity as muſt ſuppoſe all Exhortations to be vain; but I hope Men have ſince been better taught; for neither the Sin of our firſt Parents, nor our own Faults, can ſo far conſtitute us Bruits, but that we may (if we will) <hi>ſhew our ſelves Men;</hi> and in nothing doth it more concern us ſo to do, than in Things moſt immediately
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:185082:86"/>relating to the Honour of God, and our Higheſt Felicity; for on this very Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he hath given us more Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than the Beaſts of the Field, and made us capable of doing him more Honour, and being more happy: There are few Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of our Reaſon about Senſual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, but have their likeneſs in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Sagacity and Inſtincts in Brutes, and in things of that Nature ſuch may ſerve as well as Reaſon; but to conſider of God and Inviſible Things, and perform Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worſhip in a fit and decent manner; nothing but Reaſon will ſerve, and 'tis the Priviledge of Mankind alone, and therein doth our Honour and Felicity chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. But alas, how do Men cloſe their Eyes and harden their Hearts <hi>wilfully,</hi> until they provoke God to do it <hi>judicially;</hi> and becauſe they would not have the Light of Truth ſhine into their Minds, nor the Power thereof impreſs their Souls, God reſolves they ſhall not: Oh woful Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! When Men ſay to God <hi>depart from us, we deſire not the knowledge of thy Ways,</hi> and God ſaith to Men <hi>depart from me, I know you not you Workers of Iniquity.</hi> And yet as woful as it is, it ſeems to me that there be but few that dread this. What o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe can be put on the Language of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:185082:86"/>moſt Mens Lives and Converſations, but that they ſpeak them Contemners of God's gracious Preſence in the Place where he puts his Name, which he calls his Houſe, placing his Reſidence there, and owning it for his Dwelling, whence he confers his Bleſſings and Favours upon us, where we behold the Beauty of his Pleaſed Face when he lifts up the Light of his Countenance upon us in the Comfortable Promiſes of his Holy Goſpel; where we offer up our ſelves in Sacrifice unto him and ſing his Praiſes, and powre out our Souls before him in Holy Deſires, Humble Complaints, and Hearty Thankſgivings for his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the performance of theſe Holy Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for thus is God preſent in the place of Holy Aſſemblies for his Worſhip. In this <hi>Preſence</hi> of God, good Chriſtians find <hi>a Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Joy,</hi> and therefore value it above the higheſt Injoyments of the World: But how few do approve themſelves good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by this Character? Do not the moſt among us ſhew a great diſ-regard to our Publick Prayers, and ſeem not to care whether ever there were any or not? It may be, ſince Law and Cuſtom even for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them to recede from Worldly Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and go to Church on the Lord's Day, they will deſire that then they may
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:185082:87"/>have a good Preacher there that can enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them with good Language and quaint Notions to pleaſe their Ears (while they little regard the Matter of his Sermon, and much leſs the Solemn Service of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayers.) But though we have an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der eſtabliſhed by Law, <hi>that in every Pariſh-Church the Morning and Evening Prayers ſhall be ſaid daily, and a Bell rung a convenient time before they begin, that the People may come hear God's Word and to Pray with him,</hi> yet who, either Miniſters or People, regard this?</p>
               <p>It grieves me to think, that <hi>Miniſters</hi> ſhould here need Excitation, whoſe chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Joy ſhould be to Honour God and to be Examples to their Flocks; Examples I ſay of Heavenly-mindedneſs and Delight in God's Service, who therefore becauſe the Law admits an excuſe (which yet proves daily Reading <hi>ordinarily</hi>) ſhould not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it to a total omiſſion. And for the People (whom I am here writing to) it is not enough for them to go to Church on Sundays, but (if not hindred by Works of Neceſſity or Mercy) they ſhould attend dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And a plentiful Eſtate is deſirable chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly upon this account, yet the Richeſt and moſt Leaſurely Perſons never take care that this Order be obſerved by Miniſters in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:185082:87"/>their Pariſh-Churches; and when it is, will ſcarce ever come there, but make that, which ſhould give them the greateſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and Obligation to come, to be a Hindrance thereunto; I mean, make uſe of their Riches, to run themſelves into ſuch vaſt Trades and troubleſome Projects, as not to have leaſure for God's Service; or elſe (if they incline more to pleaſure than profit) they take no care to order their Divertiſements, that they be no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to the Service of God, but may make them more joyful and zealous there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, tho' this they may and ought to do, they ſuffer theſe either to ingroſs their time, that they never come to Church at all (at leaſt on Week-days) or to exhauſt their Vigour, that they are more ready to ſleep than pray when they come, and can take no delight in theſe Spiritual Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: Nay, many altogether idle (a thing tedious to Nature) and yet will not divert themſelves with going to Church; theſe are chiefly of the Female Sex, who being not ſo ſubject to be incumbred with Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and often wanting Company or Paſtimes, having nothing elſe to do; and yet, tho' they live near Churches where Prayers are daily read, they ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come there: Now what doth this ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:185082:88"/>but that ſuch care not for God, nor his Preſence? let him be gone if he will, and remove the Throne of his Grace and ſend the Ordinances of his Worſhip to them that have time and will to attend them, they have other things to do, or had rather be idle than to be at Divine Service ſeeking his Bleſſing, owning his Providence, and adoring his Holineſs; they hope to do well enough without God, and practically ſay to him as <hi>Herbert</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>We know where we can better be, than to ſerve thee;</hi> or rather, as in the Prophet, <hi>We are Lords, we will not come to thee; What is the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, that we ſhould ſerve him, and what profit ſhall we have if we call upon him? We deſire not the knowledge of his Ways:</hi> We will not trouble our heads with Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how we may beſt Honour and Pleaſe him, give us the Riches, Honours and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this World, and take thoſe of the next who will.</p>
               <p>To ſuch as theſe I would firſt ſpeak (if it were poſſible to make them hear) I would but ask them, if they were in the place of Almighty God, Whether they would indure to be ſo ſlighted? I know their pride will help here to ſhew them their own folly, in thinking to eſcape God's Vengeance whil'ſt they contemn his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:185082:88"/>Will he that is God from Everlaſting, he that gave Being to all Things, and brings them to nothing at his own Pleaſure! be diſappointed of the <hi>Honour</hi> for which he hath Made and ſtill Governs this World? (and that by ſuch a worm as man) and not Vindicate the ſame? Will he not take that Glory by his juſt Puniſhments, which they would not give in the Offices of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip? Can the Proudeſt think to reſiſt Omnipotency, or fly from Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Nay, if God ſhould do no more but withdraw his Divine Influences, we, and all we ſo love and honour above him, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh together: And can we hope God will attend us with his gracious Influences, who will not attend him with our Prayers and Praiſes? Or ſhall we ſay that we believe Almighty God takes not this for any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, but rather eſteems the Zeal I here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, to be a work of Super-errogation? Certainly we ſhall be of another mind when Sickneſs or Sorrow make us Sober, and eſpecially when we approach to Death or Judgment: I never knew any that talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this rate, but that at one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have confeſſed, that ſuch words came not from their Reaſon or Conſcience, but from their Pride and Paſſion; and that they were forc'd ſometimes to have a ſecret Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:185082:89"/>for Devout Men, and to Condemn themſelves for their Neglect of God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. There is no Man that conſults his own Reaſon, or God's Word, but muſt think God highly values his Honour, and that we do him Honour moſt immediately in this way; and if Men be not careful to <hi>honour him</hi> in this, they mean it in nothing elſe. That the love of God's Worſhip hath ever been eſteemed the firſt Principle of what we truly call Religion; That thoſe who are recorded for the moſt Holy Men and Women in Scripture, have been the greateſt lovers of God's Houſe; and that upon this very account, that it was the Place where <hi>his Honour dwelt,</hi> and becauſe they were inamoured of the Beauty of his Infinite Goodneſs ſhining there in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, deſired to be inſtructed by his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom there appearing in his Laws to be aſſiſted and comforted by his Grace exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in his Sacraments, and prepared for Heavenly Glory by theſe Holy Exerciſes of his Worſhip; this made them love the Place where they might ſee and injoy him to theſe great purpoſes. Again, 'tis moſt evident to conſidering Men, That it was the Happineſs of the State of Innocency, that Man had nothing elſe to do but to Worſhip and Praiſe his Maker; (at leaſt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:185082:89"/>nothing that might divert him from it.) And that it ſhall be our chief Happineſs in the State of Glory, to be freed from all Cumberſome Labours and Cares, and all Diſtracting Proſecutions and Carnal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and that we ſhall then continually attend Divine Offices, as that which is our only perfect Bliſs and Felicity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould eſteem ourſelves the more Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for having a Receſs from Worldly Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs now, that we may more freely and frequently attend Divine Offices.</p>
               <p>Again, 'tis evident that God who firſt made all things for himſelf, created again his Church and People, <hi>that they might be to the praiſe of the Glory of his Grace,</hi> Eph. 1. And all Chriſtian Aſſemblies are ſo conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and Holy Offices appointed therein, that they may be ſo; therefore for Men to call themſelves Chriſtians and Members of ſuch Aſſemblies, and yet deſpiſe Publick Worſhip, is a great Affront to God and to the Church, which hath well appointed theſe Daily Offices of Divine Worſhip, as being agreeable to Reaſon, to the Divine Preſcriptions, and to the Cuſtoms of the wiſeſt of Mankind, and requires our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon them when ever we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem time from the Buſineſs that is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to our Maintainance, and the Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:185082:90"/>that are neceſſary for our Health, both which are allow'd in moſt caſes for our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe; and thoſe that will think of more, I believe will find themſelves miſtaken at the Day of Judgment.</p>
               <p>Theſe Things, and much more that might be ſaid of like nature, being ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, I muſt believe theſe kind of Men, that think our Daily Attendance at Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers is being Righteous over much, are not moved hereunto by any thing of Reaſon or Sober Conſideration; but are wholly influenced by Pride or Covetouſneſs, or other Carnal Affections, which hinder the Exerciſe of their Rational Faculties, and make them live more of the Animal than the Divine Life, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> more like Beaſts than Men; and ſo long as they are ſuch, we muſt expect no other Language from them; for the Carnal Mind (a Man that diſcourſeth as a meer Animal) perceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he know them, becauſe they are Spiritually diſcerned; and therefore it will be in vain for me to ſay any more to them, then earneſtly to deſire them, <hi>To pluck out the</hi> Beam <hi>that is in their own Eye, and then ſhall they ſee clearly to pluck out the</hi> Mote <hi>that is in their Brothers:</hi> For an <hi>Extream</hi> in this matter, (if any man be ſuppoſed to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:185082:90"/>thereof) is no more, in compariſon of their total Neglect and Contempt of God and his Publick Worſhip, than a <hi>Mote</hi> to a <hi>Beam,</hi> as they will find at the laſt.</p>
               <p>The Second Sort to whom I ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my ſelf, and for whoſe ſake I chiefly undertook this Work, is ſuch as have a love for theſe Holy Offices and daily fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent them; to whom my earneſt Requeſt is, That they will perſiſt in the good way they have begun, attend to the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of performance, and make all the reſt of their Lives anſwer to their Devotion herein. I doubt not but ſuch who do underſtand the Grounds and Reaſons upon which our Publick Service was firſt ordered, and have taken up this practice, in a ſenſe of their Duty to God and Man, will eaſily and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually comply with my Deſire, and ſave me the Labour of Arguments. I ſhall only ſay, the Inward Peace and Satisfaction they will find in governing themſelves in this Matter, by Reaſon and not by Fancy, and in following the Cuſtom and Uſage of all good Chriſtians for many Ages, and of moſt even in this, (and not that of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Schiſmaticks) by obeying the Orders of our own Church, made with the greateſt Advice and by the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bias'd Perſons of any in the World; and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:185082:91"/>not Herding with Quakers, Fifth-Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy men, Anabaptiſts, and other turbulent Sects, that oppoſe the ſame and ſeek its Ruin; the Satisfaction they will have in finding all that was Good and Profitable, all that was Decent and Solemn, all that was truly Primitive or any way Praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy in the Service of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (a Church which was once very Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for Learning, Piety, and Stedfaſtneſs in the Faith) ſtill retained in ours; and all that which Ignorance, Error, or the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Time had introduced into that, purged out in this: I ſay, the Satisfaction they will find in conſidering the Excellency of our Form of Divine Service, in this and ſuch like reſpects, <hi>Will prevent all Inclinations to turn into other Ways.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſhould they have any Scruples ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted unto them by cunning Seducers, I dare ſay, if they will but do (what may be juſtly expected from Men ſo educated and obliged,) that is, Conſult the Miniſters of our Church, they will find the fulleſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction that they can deſire.</p>
               <p>Again, As theſe Conſiderations, ſo the good Effects of a Devout Attending this Service, will perſwade them to continue the ſame: The Exaltation of our Minds, thereby, above the mean Concerns of this
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:185082:91"/>World, ſo that they ſhall not be influenced by the Revolutions and infinite Changes to which it is ſubject; the Confirmation of our Faith and Hope in God's Promiſes, and the inward Joy and Peace that reſults there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from; the Excitation of our Love to God, and the Exerciſing thereof in Holy Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Cheerful Praiſes; the Increaſe of our Love to one another by Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in ſuch Sacred Offices: theſe and ſuch like, which will be the Effects of attending this Service, will inforce our delight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and our endeavours, ſo to order it, that we be not kept from the ſame. To which I may add ſome outward good Effects, ſuch as, 1. The Preventing many Idle, and, ſometimes, very Chargeable Clubs and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits, from which this will both excuſe and oblige us. 2. The inducing Harmony and Good Order into our Families: For our contriving that as many as poſſible may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend God's Service, will make much for Order in other things, and alſo for Love and Peace and Good Succeſs of our Affairs. I cannot attend the Demonſtration, but I am ſure he that will try, ſhall find it true by Experience. 3. The Chearfulneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into our Minds by our Communion in the Pſalmody and Reſponſes, and the uſe of our Voice in other parts of the Service,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:185082:92"/>tends much to the health of our Bodies and the mending our Temper: For as ſilence feeds the Melancholy Humour (the worſt that Mans Body is affected with, and of moſt pernicious influence on the Mind) ſo Speaking, and eſpecially in ſuch Heavenly Converſe, doth much to diſſolve and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſe the ſame, and preſerves the Body healthful and lively, and the Mind in a ſweet and pleaſant Temper. I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no more, I hope it may ſuffice to have touched theſe things in ſo ſhort a Diſcourſe to perſwade a Conſtant Attendance on the Publick Prayers.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. I ſhall ſay ſomewhat alſo to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade an indeavour of a right performance, which even thoſe are in danger not to do who daily frequent theſe Holy Offices. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, Cuſtom, and various Intereſts may have great force to effect a conſtant atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance at Prayers, when yet want of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration may betray Men to Formality and undue Performance. There is a <hi>Fear of God</hi> (ſo his Worſhip of old was called,) <hi>which is taught by the Precepts of Men,</hi> Matth. 15.8. and this is when Men go to Church meerly becauſe the Magiſtrate Commands, or their Parents bred them to it, or becauſe it is the Cuſtom of their Neighbours ſo to do: Theſe ſhew themſelves of a good dactile
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:185082:92"/>and ſociable Temper, and are more to be eſteemed than ſuch, who, in deſpite of the Laws, good Education, and a pious Coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, contemn and ſcorn a daily atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on God's Worſhip: Or than thoſe that ſtrain their Wits to find Faults in our Liturgy, and that do all they can to create Scruples in themſelves and infuſe them into others. But they muſt not reſt here, but while they conſtantly go to Prayers, they muſt indeavour to exerciſe that Fervent Love to God and to our Bleſſed Saviour, and that Divine Joy in the Hope of Glory to come, and to Fore-taſte the Bleſſedneſs we ſhall partake of in the Communion of Saints above in theſe Exerciſes, wherein (as Saints) we have communion here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and will, to that purpoſe, attend more diligently to the Preparations wherewith they ſhould come to Worſhip, and to thoſe Expreſſions whereby they Honour God while they do ſo.</p>
               <p>Therefore I beſeech theſe to whom I write to conſider, <hi>that God will be Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all thoſe that come nigh to Worſhip him;</hi> and this he only is by thoſe who <hi>Worſhip him with a Holy Worſhip,</hi> both Internally and Externally: Which we do not, except our Minds be ſo diſpoſed, and our Words and Actions ſo ordered, as is aforeſaid, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:185082:93"/>as becomes the Glory of God's Eſſence, the Immenſity of his Divine Perfections, the Senſe of our own Concernments and of our Relation to thoſe we are to pray with, and to pray for; and ſo as is ſuitable to the ſeveral Parts of Worſhip which we are to perform. Now theſe Diſpoſitions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be attained but by ſerious and frequent Meditation: For there is a Connexion in the Duties of Religion, which make it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to perform ſome as we ought, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we make Conſcience of others that are preparatory thereunto; in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion I ſuppoſe <hi>Meditation</hi> to be the firſt, and he that makes no Conſcience of that, or knows not how to Perform it, will be hardly brought to a Good Performance in any other Duties, eſpecially this of Prayer. Men may by a natural fluency of Speech, aſſiſted with a quickneſs of Wit and ready Invention, eaſily pray to good acceptance with Men: but as to our acceptance with God, and the effects of Prayer to our own Benefit and Conſolation, it depends on the preparation of ſuch Affections, and ſuch Expreſſions thereof, as can never be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out frequent <hi>Meditation.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Meditation</hi> in the moſt common ſenſe of the word, is taken for more than bare think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it is <hi>a thinking of things, that we may
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:185082:93"/>have ſuch knowledge of them, and eſteem and affection toward them as we ought to have:</hi> And ſo great an Influence hath the <hi>propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed End</hi> into the Efficacy of any Action, that I cannot expect that any Man ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite his Devotion by thinking of things though never ſo Divine, except he deſigns by ſuch thinking ſo to do: Students of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts are ingaged to think of ſuch things as would ſerve to this and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Ends, but without any Effect. The Reaſon is, becauſe their Minds by being ſo intently fixed on the love of Carnal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, do not diſcern even the things they look full upon, nor underſtand thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things they teach to others; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' they are conſtrained to think how they may talk or write of ſuch things, yet they are with-held by theſe Senſual Affections from conſidering the Concern which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have therein.</p>
               <p>There is no way therefore by meditating, to attain Devotion or any Vertue, but by crucifying the Fleſh, with all its Affections and Luſts, and awakening our dead and drouzy Souls to <hi>deſign</hi> and <hi>endeavour</hi> to live that <hi>Life</hi> for which they were made, and in which alone they can be made happy: And to this our Bleſſed Saviour hath given us ſuch Aſſiſtance by the Grace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:185082:94"/>that no Man that will take hold of it can complain of infirmity; for altho' we never ſo much feel the weight of earthly things which preſs down the Soul, as when we ſtrive to aſcend to God in the Exerciſes of Devotion, yet if we fix our Minds on him who was God manifeſted in the Fleſh, ſhewing us how little theſe things are (how great ſoever they ſeem;) how little to be deſired or feared, tho' ſeemingly dreadful or pleaſant, by his refuſing all the Glories we ſo eagerly proſecute, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Sufferings we ſo fear and fly; and would contemplate the Heavenly Joys which he offereth us, on condition we will receive his Spirit, and lead our Lives after the Pattern he hath ſet us; I ſay, if we would thus <hi>look unto Jeſus, (the Author and Finiſher of our Faith)</hi> we ſhould ſoon find ourſelves able <hi>to lay aſide theſe Weights (how eaſily ſoever they beſet us)</hi> and to aſcend to him in Holy and Devout Affections, while we are imployed in theſe Sacred Offices.</p>
               <p>But it is not ſo much the want of Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as of Intention, that is cauſe of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of Devotion, as I ſaid before, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to awaken that I would repreſent the Excellency of this Heavenly Affection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Devotion</hi> it is a moſt Divine Spirit in Man, his greateſt Exaltation above Beaſts,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:185082:94"/>and his neareſt Approach to Angels; 'tis (as <hi>Herbert</hi> ſaith of the Sabbath) the Fruit of this World and the Bloſſom of the next, the higheſt enjoyment which we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of here, and the fore-taſte of what we ſhall moſt fully enjoy hereafter. It tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the Soul into a Seraphim, burning with the Fervours of Divine Love, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to Heaven (as <hi>Elias</hi>) in a Fiery Charriot to take its place in the Choir of Angels, and joyn in their Halalujahs, and Adorations of him that ſits on the Throne, and of the Lamb that is at his Right Hand. But yet it carries us not above any of the Concerns wherein we may be uſeful to Men, but deſcends to the Conſideration of all their Wants and Neceſſities, Sorrows and Miſeries, taking them into its Breaſt, and preſenting them before God, with earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt requeſt for comfort and relief in them all; yea, it begets in Men ſuch a Divine Charity as reacheth to the uttermoſt of what may be done for the Well-fare and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Neighbours. For while we Adore God, who is the Supream Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, and our Saviour, (God-Man) the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Self-denial and Meekneſs, (Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that Cure our Hurtful Luſts) and ſuch a lover of Men as to proſecute their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Felicity, with the ſhedding of his
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:185082:95"/>moſt Precious Blood. I ſay, while this is the Object of our Adoration, as it is in theſe Exerciſes of Devotion, how can it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiiſe but that it muſt beget in us a Life and Temper moſt pleaſant and profitable to Mankind? And indeed I have obſerved, that this <hi>Heavenly Flame</hi> of <hi>True Devotion</hi> is like that which deſcended on <hi>Elias</hi>'s Altar, it licks up all our oppoſite Intereſts (as that did the Water) and makes both ourſelves and all we have, a Sacrifice to the Honour of God and Good of Mankind: None there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that conſiders the Excellency of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but would ſet himſelf with great atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mind, to the Conſideration of ſuch Things as may render him a Devout Man.</p>
               <p>The Things that are of this Nature are principally ſuch as relate to God, to Our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or to Others we are to Pray for. We ſhould think upon God, That he is worthy all our Adorations and Praiſes, for his Glorious and Infinite Perfections, his Wonderful Works, and for his Innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Bleſſings and Mercies: That he, and <hi>he only, heareth Prayers, and is nigh to all that call upon him,</hi> and is pleaſed when Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the things he is willing to give us: That he alone Orders and Diſpoſeth all the Affairs of this World, according to his Soveraign Will and Pleaſure; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:185082:95"/>or Inlarges the Powers of Nature; Stops or Diverts the Courſe of it; Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules Second Cauſes; Proſpers or Diſappoints Human Undertakings; Gives and Takes away; Lifts up and Caſts down, even how and whom he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>We ſhould think of our Dependance on him, That we Live, Move, and have our Being in him, and cannot Subſiſt a moment without him; that we are ſubject to innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Caſualties, which may deſtroy the ſtrongeſt Body and healthfulleſt Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to ſuch Vexations as will four the ſweeteſt Temper, and to ſuch Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as will ſhake the moſt fixed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Mind, which he only can prevent from befalling us, (as being under his Divine Government) and can by his immediate Influxes Comfort us when they do ſo. We ſhould think how many things we want; what woful things we are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of; of our manifold Temptations, by allurements of ſenſual Objects, and ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of evil Spirits; of the weakneſs of our Graces and inſufficiency of all things in Heaven or Earth beſides God for our Supply and Succour: And if we would think ſeriouſly of theſe things, we ſhould find great help to Devotion in Prayers thereby; we ſhall find how much we are
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:185082:96"/>concerned to reconcile ourſelves to God by humble and penitent Confeſſions, to ſeek his Grace and Favour by Fervent Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to pray for the Aid of his Spirit to help our Infirmity, and to aſſiſt our Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over our Spiritual Enemies; and to give him thanks that we have not fallen into greater Sins and Miſeries; to attend to his Holy Word, that thereby we may receive Grace from him, to learn to pleaſe him and oblige his care and kindneſs for us, and theſe things will beget and excite De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Affections in us.</p>
               <p>It will be profitable alſo to this End, to think of our Obligation to our Chriſtian Brethren, and of the Particular Regards we ought to have towards all Sorts and Degrees among them: For we Pray, as Members of the Catholick Church; and muſt have a Concern for all Chriſtians as Fellow-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one Spiritual Incorporation. But particularly, we ſhould often think what Affection we ſhould bear to thoſe, whether our Superiors, Equals, or Inferiors, with whom we are united, as one Nation and National Church, and alſo ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to repreſent to ourſelves what may be the ſeveral States and Conditions of thoſe we are preſently to joyn with, in the performance of Sacred Offices: Such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:185082:96"/>will much help our Devotion; for the ſenſe of the ſins of others to whom we are united (as well as of our own) will help to make us humble and contrite in our Confeſſions; the ſenſe of their Wants and Miſeries will help to make us fervent in our Supplications; the ſenſe of the Mercies they receive, will help to make us joyful in God's Praiſes, becauſe we are obliged by our Union to reckon their Sins, their Wants and their Mercies our own. Thus the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral knowledge that multitudes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as well as our ſelves, are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Matter of our Prayers, and the ſenſe we have, in particular, of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of many of thoſe we preſently joyn with, will add much more to our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. It may be there are many things in the Publick Prayers that we have not at preſent ſuch a particular Concernment in, but, when we think there are Millions of Chriſtians that have, who are all of the ſame Divine Incorporation, and that many of them are our own Country-men united with us, as a National Church, and ſome our Neighbours, with whom we are one, as a Parochial Church, and of whoſe Concern we may have a particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. I ſay, this Meditation will greatly aſſiſt our Devotions, and will alſo increaſe
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:185082:97"/>that Charity, without which our Prayers as well as Ourſelves are counted but dead in the fight of God: And when we have wrought Ourſelves to this excellent Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, our love to our Brethren will help our Devotion another way alſo. For it will make us endeavour, by our example, to make them Devout; and the more defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective we do perceive their Devotion to be, the more ſhall we indeavour to aſſiſt it, by the perfection of our own. And there is certainly no better way; for I have known thoſe that Reproof and Diſputation did but irritate, by ſuch Examples to have been reformed.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Frequent Reading theſe Holy Offices by ourſelves, and ſerious Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereon, would be a great help to our Devotion, (and <hi>Dr.</hi> Comber<hi>'s Excellent Book on the ſeveral Office of the Common Prayer,</hi> will much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> us therein;) for when we have a full underſtanding of the great things contained in the brief compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Sentences of the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> and of our <hi>Collects,</hi> &amp;c. the memory thereof, when we come to repeat them, will much aſſiſt our Devotion: And I am perſwaded, that if Men were but converſant in the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the <hi>Common Prayer-Book,</hi> they would find more Inſtruction in the Matter of their
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:185082:97"/>Duty to God and Man; more Aſſiſtance in governing their Affections and Paſſions and preſerving Peace in themſelves; more Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and Conſolation in Troubles and Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and more Aid againſt Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than in reading many Books; but eſpecially it would be an excellent Means to increaſe thoſe Holy Affections which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us for Publick Prayers, and to aſſiſt our Devotion in the Performance.</p>
               <p>I have mentioned this little of a great deal that might be ſaid, of the Matter of our Meditation: but ſtill it muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that theſe things be thought on with a purpoſe and intention to beget in us ſuch <hi>habitual Affections and Diſpoſitions,</hi> that we may be always fit to Pray: and may in the moſt wonted Expreſſions, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe a ſervent Devotion: and if we do ſo, we ſhall not ſo need the Natural or Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Rethorick in Prayer as thoſe do that want theſe Diſpoſitions; nor ſhall we be cloy'd with having Prayers always the ſame; as ſome Dainty Stomachs are with eating often the ſame Meats; for ſuch Men conſtantly carry in their Breaſt ſuch a ſenſe of their paſt Enormities, that it puts Life into their repeating our <hi>General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion;</hi> and ſuch Eſteem of God's Mercy in Chriſt, as gives them a Behaviour, not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:185082:98"/>in receiving Abſolution; they have ſuch Affection towards the Glory and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Almighty God, and ſuch belief that he only can give what we want, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the Sins, and prevent the Temptations that would involve us in evil, now in this World, and eternally in the next: that it gives a great Devotion to their ſaying the <hi>Lord's Prayer;</hi> and all the reſt tho' they are ſtill the ſame.</p>
               <p>And where Men have ſuch ſenſe, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks no Man ſhould deny that they pray in the Spirit or in the Holy Ghoſt, as the Precepts of the Goſpel require: That Pious Nonconformiſt, Mr. <hi>J. Corbet,</hi> in his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> hath theſe words, <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prayer is never wanting, where the Heart hath a due ſenſe of the Matter:</hi> pag. 46. <hi>Although</hi> (as he afterwards explains it,) <hi>we uſe a ſtinted Form of Words.</hi> Dr. <hi>Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en</hi> I confeſs, in a late Diſcourſe of Prayer, hath theſe words; <hi>If Perſons are able, in the reading any Book, meerly of Human Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, to riſe up in anſwer to this Duty of Praying with all manner of Prayer and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication in the Spirit, or the exerciſe of the Aids and Aſſiſtances received from him and his Holy Acting in them as a Spirit of Grace and Supplication, endeavouring, labouring and watching thereunto; they have attained what
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:185082:98"/>I cannot underſtand.</hi> That is in plain words, the Doctor cannot underſtand how a Man, that uſes a Form, can be ſaid <hi>to pray in the Spirit:</hi> It would be a high preſumption in me to queſtion the Underſtanding of ſo Great a Man; but he will not be angry if I queſtion my own: for I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, why our Saviour (from whom we have theſe Precepts of Praying in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) ſhould teach his Diſciples a Form of Prayer, if in uſing a Form we cannot pray in the Spirit. But it may be the Doctor will ſay (as he doth inſinuate in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that Book,) that Chriſt gave thoſe words only for a Doctrinal and Directive Help to Prayer, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> To teach Men how to pray <hi>Ex tempore;</hi> for <hi>which End</hi> (he ſaith) we may read Forms of Prayer (how unlawful ſoever the uſe be, for which they were made.) But then I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how the Doctor can ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 234. <hi>That it were better (it may be) that this were done:</hi> (Men taught to pray <hi>Ex tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore</hi>) <hi>in ſome other way, and</hi> theſe Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Directive Helps <hi>not caſt into the Form of a Prayer, which is apt to divert the Mind from its proper End and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Which words ſeem to me, to have ſuch a Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on our Bleſſed Saviour as is little ſhort of Blaſphemy; (according to the Doctor's O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:185082:99"/>of the <hi>Lord's Prayer:</hi>) For if that were not intended for a Form, but for a <hi>Doctrinal and Directive Help to Prayer;</hi> then thoſe words applied to him, plainly ſay, <hi>That it may be, Chriſt might have done better, than to have caſt his Inſtructions and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions about Prayer into the Form of a Prayer, which is apt to divert the Mind from its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per End and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe:</hi> which to ſay, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach <hi>the Wiſdom of God-incarnate,</hi> and to tell Our great Teacher, <hi>ſent from God,</hi> that he did not underſtand his Office, nor teach, in the beſt manner, a thing of greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to the Glory of God, and Happineſs of Mankind (as the Doctor rightly ſaith, the well performance of Prayer is.) Words, which no Chriſtian can patiently hear of his Saviour. Now, according to my weak opinion, there is but one of theſe two ways for the <hi>Doctor</hi> to avoid this conſequence from his words, either that he confeſs the truth and ſay, That our Saviour intended to teach his Diſciples a Form of Prayes, and that it is not only Lawful, but a Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Duty to uſe this his Holy Prayer as we do. Or, if he will hold to this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <hi>viz.</hi> That 'tis a Doctrinal and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Help to teach to Pray <hi>Ex tempere;</hi> Then he muſt prove, that it is not <hi>caſt into the Form of a Prayer.</hi> Now this later ſeems
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:185082:99"/>utterly impoſſible to be done; for ſince it ſo plainly appears, that it is <hi>caſt into the Form of a Prayer.</hi> And ſince the Chriſtians of many Ages throughout the World, have eſteemed and uſed it as a Form of Prayer. And ſince the <hi>Doctor</hi> himſelf (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his Opinion that it was not ſo intended) cannot forbear in many places of his Book to call it <hi>The Lord's Prayer.</hi> I ſay, ſince it is ſo, he will never make Men believe it is not caſt into the Form of <hi>a Prayer:</hi> Therefore I hope the <hi>Doctor</hi> on ſecond thoughts will retract his Book, and confeſs that there is a Work of the Spirit in Prayer that he hath therein much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. A Work wherein he moved our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and Holy Men to compoſe <hi>Forms</hi> of Prayer, and to teach their Diſciples to ſay them, as the beſt Help to Prayer. A Work whereby he moved and inabled our Reformers (as well as the Governours of other Churches) to Compoſe and Preſcribe <hi>a Liturgy</hi> or Form for the Publick Service of God. A Work whereby he excites Men to approach daily to God in this Solemn Office of Prayer in the Church, and not to think it enough to Pray occaſionally, when they are preſſed with the preſent ſenſe of Dangers, Miſeries, or Wants,) as I confeſs every Chriſtian can and may do in his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:185082:100"/>
                  <hi>Ex tempore.</hi> A Work whereby he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Men thankfully to accept, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to uſe as Prayers, the Form our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour taught; and other Forms taught and preſcribed as before. Laſtly, A Work whereby he teacheth, and aſſiſts, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations I before mentioned; that in the uſe of ſuch Forms we may be truly devout and fervent. And if the <hi>Doctor</hi> will believe and conſider this, I hope he will uſe no more ſuch Inſinuations to perſwade that no Forms of Prayer ſhould ever hereafter be made; nor thoſe that are, be uſed any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than to help the attainment of the Art of Praying <hi>Ex tempore:</hi> nor will (while he profeſſeth to oppoſe our Liturgy, as ſet up to exclude their Way of Praying) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by ſuch Inſinuations to baniſh our Way of Praying out of the World (as the uſe of <hi>Ex tempore</hi> Prayer did once the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy out of the Church:) And I hope the <hi>Doctor</hi> will excuſe this warmth, which the conceit of ſuch a deſign hath occaſioned. But (to return) if our Saviour meant to teach a Form of Prayer, there can be no greater proof than that, That in the uſe of Forms we may beſt pray in the Spirit. For ſince by his Inſpiration the Precept of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Spirit was given, the Way of Prayer he taught, muſt be acknowledged
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:185082:100"/>beſt for the performing the ſame. This I hope, will put an end to the common way of appropriating the phraſe of <hi>Praying in the Spirit,</hi> to the uſe of <hi>Ex tempore</hi> Prayer, and give thoſe, that pray by Forms, and by our Liturgy, ſome ſhare in the honour of it; and then I hope we ſhall hear no more Scoffing at Praying by the Spirit (which this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation hath cauſed, however the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor complains of it) which I by no means approve.</p>
               <p>But Laſtly, When we have done our beſt in our Preparations and Performances, we muſt take heed that all be not intended to gain an Indulgence for living in any Sin, either of Omiſſion or Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>The Enemies of our Church boaſt much of their good Lives; and condemn us, that are for the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> as a profane ſort of Men: I do heartily wiſh them as good as they think themſelves, and that their goodneſs may conſiſt as much in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of their Paſſions, in Juſt Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions, in Meekneſs, Humility and Candid Interpretations, as in decrying Senſual Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Worldly Pomps and Vanities: And I wiſh alſo, that ours did not give juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for this their complaint; and that we may indeavour to Equal (yea Excel them in Temperance and Heavenly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;

But that I may alſo to my Wiſhes add my Faithful Endeavours, I ſhall offer Two Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to perſwade thereunto, 1. That, of the Incongruity of a Vicious Life to daily Attendance on Divine Service and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Devout therein: 2. Of the Unaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablneſs thereof without the Conjunction of a Holy Life.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Incongruity is Evident to all Men. None that ſee a Man to go conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Church, to bow very low at his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in, to appear very devout in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts of Worſhip, both by Speech and Behaviour; I ſay, they that ſee this, expect that ſuch a one ſhould be very exact in the Courſe of his Life: And if they come to know, that they are not, they will be very apt to take offence at it: I confeſs, for my own part, it hath been ſo with me, and others have told me it hath been ſo with them, and reaſon tells me it muſt be ſo with all: For it is abſurd to hear a Man at Church very devoutly to own himſelf a ſinner, and condemn himſelf of ſillineſs in wandring from God's Ways and following his own Deſires and Devices, (as in our <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Confeſſion</hi>) and then return home as Proud and Self-conceited as ever, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:185082:102"/>the leſs inclin'd to wander from God in proſecution of Self ſatisfaction as before. To call God our Father at Church, as if we did partake of a Nature like his, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to all Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs and Truth, and when we come Home (by our Ill Nature and Deſtructive Practices) to ſhew ourſelves the Children of the Devil. To call him, <hi>Our Father in Heaven:</hi> when neither the conſideration of the Heavenly Original of our Souls, generated firſt by Divine Spiration, and regenerated by that Word which is of Divine Inſpiration (on both which accounts we call him <hi>our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>) can raiſe our Minds from this Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill Earth, to ſeek the Things above: Nor the Heighth and Excellency of God's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and his Advantage of Seeing and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing (expreſſed by his <hi>being in Heaven,</hi>) can move us to fear him. To Pray, that <hi>his Name may be Hallowed;</hi> and then Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane it ourſelves, (by uſing it in vain and light Interjections, or by Oaths and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations in our common talk) and cauſing it to be profaned by others, through our vicious and ſcandalous Lives. <hi>That his Kingdom may come;</hi> and yet riſe in Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt the Holy Government of his Spirit in our Hearts; and againſt the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſals of his Providences, as to our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

To Pray, <hi>That his Will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven,</hi> when yet our Obedience is ſo dull and heavy, and as it were conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by neceſſity, and ſo very unlike the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who in doing the Will of God, fly with all alacrity; all this is very abſurd and incongruous. I may add the Indecency of our Grumbling if we are not as Rich as our Neighbours, and our Diſcontent at Loſſes and Croſſes, though we have more than enough left; when yet we pray but <hi>for our daily Bread:</hi> Our Implacableneſs and Irreconcilableneſs towards thoſe that offend us, when we pray <hi>to be forgiven no otherwiſe than as we forgive:</hi> And laſtly, that when we pray <hi>that God will not lead us into Temptations,</hi> we do ſo heedleſly or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly run into them; I ſay, ſo <hi>run</hi> into Temptations, that without a Miracle God himſelf cannot <hi>deliver us from evil,</hi> when we may be ſure he will work no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, in favour of ſuch, as offer themſelves as a prey to Satan, by their running into Temptation, and neglecting the Means of their own Preſervation.</p>
               <p>I hint theſe things from the beginning
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:185082:103"/>of our Service, that we may ſee the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity of a wicked Life with the whole.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> The Unacceptableneſs of all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Devotion, from Men of ſuch vicious and profane Lives. <hi>The ſacrifices of the wicked are an abomination to the Lord, 'tis the prayer of the righteous that is his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the wicked ſaith God, What haſt to do to take my Name into thy mouth, ſince thou hateſt to be reformed, and caſteth my words behind thee?</hi> The moſt Solemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of ſuch Men for his Worſhip and Service is a burden to him; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. the reaſon is, becauſe his infinite Veracity makes him to hate their Hypocrifie, his juſt Reſentments of their bold breaking his Laws, when ever the Devil and their Luſts tempt them to it, makes his Diſpleaſure to ariſe at their Fawning when theſe are ſatisfied. To give real Worſhip to Satan by doing his Luſts, and to live to the Fleſh, by fulfilling its Deſires, and then to make theſe outward Appearances of great Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards God, makes his Jealouſies burn like that of an abuſed Husband, when his Wife fawns on him after her Adulterous Embraces. 'Tis our Hearts that are God's Peculiar, and if we ſuffer any thing to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh or defile them, <hi>the ſacrifices of our lips will not be accepted.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:185082:104"/>
               <p> But now how excellently doth <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> ſute together? and how graciouſly doth God accept ſuch in whom they are conjoyned? To ſee a Man that makes acknowledgment of a moſt Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Trimendous Deity by Solemn Acts of Worſhip in the Morning; <hi>Walking in the Fear of God all the Day long.</hi> To ſee a Man after he hath Celebrated God's Glorious Perfections (Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Truth, Faithfulneſs, Patience, Long-ſuffering and Forgiveneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) in the Solemn Office of Thankſgiving, ſtriving to imitate them in the Courſe of his Life. To ſee a Man after the Cup of Bleſſing received at the hands of God's Miniſters with great Devotion, to declare, by his Converſation, that he hath thereby been made to drink into the ſame Spirit with his Saviour: That he is Lowly, Meek, and Patient; Loving, and Diligent in doing others good; a Contemner of things below, earneſtly ſeeking thoſe above, as Chriſt was: I ſay, to ſee this is moſt lovely, becauſe theſe things do ſo excellently agree. And ſuch Men in whom theſe are united, are moſt acceptable in their approaches to God; he is well pleaſed with their Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Praiſes, delights to hear their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and will ſhew ſuch tokens for their good; <hi>that they may always ſee to their joy,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:185082:104"/>and their enemies oft to their ſhame.</hi> And I am perſwaded if the People of this Church will join theſe Two Things in their conſtant Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, God will ſo Bleſs us, that all the Ends of the Earth ſhall Fear him; <hi>(i e.)</hi> be allured by the Flouriſhing Glory of our Church and State, to Imitate the Excellent Order der of our Divine Service.</p>
               <p>And if they would but conſider what good effects this would have (to the healing our Breaches and reſtoring us to Love and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty among ourſelves, making us a Joy to our Friends, and a Terror to our Enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and preventing the Miſeries we lately felt and preſently fear at home) and will not ſuffer themſelves to be blinded by Paſſion and Prejudice, and the ill Arts of diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men; I ſay, they could not chuſe but put their helping hand to effect the conjunction.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore, with my Earneſt Prayer to Almighty God for the good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of this Book, affectionately deſigned to perſwade Men to a Decent Performance of Holy Offices, and to Exemplary Piety in all their Converſes, That, by his Bleſſing, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all its defects, it may fully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its End; and to this Prayer I hope all Good Men will ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>
